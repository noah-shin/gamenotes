> ‘‘Live’’ is meant to signify that the participants of the game are interacting face to face 
> It is important to establish exactly what is meant by the term ‘‘live role-playing game.’’ The term, as it is used here, can be best broken down into its components parts. The easiest to explain, the term ‘‘live’’ is meant to signify that the participants of the game are interacting face to face (rather than through some form of distance communication using the Internet or telephones).

oh Interesting
i wonder if he'd include discord as Live - tho he clearly states its not internet or telephone based - but is it a matter of immediacy and visualisation or is it an involvement of all the senses?

> However, all live RPGs provide the players (including the GM) with the opportunity to participate in a collective and democratic process of narrative creation, social production, and reproduction of solidarity, and active engagement with normative and deviant social behavior (Bowman, 2011; Dormans, 2006; Fine, 1983).

> The central difference between the two categories derives from the form of acting that the players perform. In the former type, players generally describe their characters’ respective actions, whereas in the latter, players generally embody their respective characters, acting and reacting as their characters would.
