> [!quote] pg5 : Myths are the narratives in the creation of particular religions. 
> Myths, as they are referred to in this work, are the narratives that accompany beliefs, norms, and rituals in the creation of particular religions. 
> In common parlance, a ‘‘myth’’ has become any elaborate tale that is false but passed off as if it is true—indeed, this is one of the dictionary definitions of the term (Oxford English Dictionary, 2012).

> [!quote] pg 5 : However, unlike mythology, folktales are not tied to religious belief.
> They are instead an act of heritage creation, a means of connecting an ethnic group with their common worldly history (fictionalized or otherwise), rather than their shared otherworldly creation and devotion. Such stories are passed from one generation to the next as a kind of narrative heirloom and have historically been insular by nature (Georges & Jones, 1995; Radcliffe-Brown, 1968).

I so profoundly disagree it's actually fascinating.
How would I define it, and why am I so resistant to those definitions?

> It is a story or a ritual, mostly imagined, that reflects a culture and accounts for humankind's role within it, either as individuals or as a society.

> Facts are mythic; even if we know that people went to the moon, it is recited in the same way as the Greek tales and has the same impact of inspiration and unity.

SOME THOUGHTS

> [!quote] pg 7 : Five social purposes of the folk narrative form
> a. Exaggerated communication of expected norms, including reinforcement of dominance relationships.
> b. Providing a people with a sense of solidarity through shared history and common totemic symbols.
> c. Facilitating a sense of cultural empowerment through the portrayal of the victories of common cultural heroes.
> d. Creating a system of mastery and ownership over the heritage and characteristics of the society.
> e. Entertainment and leisure through nostalgia and imaginative experience.

I Get what he's saying about a), but its an interesting **direct** contradiction to smthg like critical role, who's central arc through all the campaigns has been the destruction of celestial beings - not just hubris or the downfall of the inferior, but the Success over the 'dominant'.

> Take a full measure of control over this complex system of solidarity and history
> These narratives, and their active communication by contemporary members of the in-group, allow the people also to take a full measure of control over this complex system of solidarity and history (Bascom, 1954).

> [!quote] pg 8 
> With such flexibility, the story may be molded to fit the changing times, accounting for the rise of new normative conditions and taboos, changing environment and contact with other cultures, and other cultural shifts that necessitate malleability in a narrative if it is to remain relevant and meaningful.
> License over the content and communication of myth and folk narratives has impact as well on the flows of power and in-group pride for a people. Like the shared glory of mighty ancestors and godly figures, mastery over the arc of the narrative and the exact turn of events facilitates an in-group power.

I like this part generally, but that's because it's an empowering statement - I identify with the telling of mythology and of the storyteller, which therefore puts me in a position to be benefiting from these claims.
