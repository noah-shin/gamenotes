An interesting, and true, thought - though juxtaposed with modern understandings of gender and trans identification.

E.g.

Indeed, I agree that there are "permeable boundaries between butch women and transsexual men" (pg 40).

And it's a curious question.

> What allows for female embodiment in the case of the butch and refuses such embodiment in the case of the female-to-male transsexual? How do butches and FTMs view their differences?

How do *I* view the difference?

But that also begs the question - *what delineates female masculinity and male femininity*?
