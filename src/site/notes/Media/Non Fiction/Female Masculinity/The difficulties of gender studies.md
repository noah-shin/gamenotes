Linked to the topic of [[Media/Non Fiction/Queer Data\|Queer Data]], Halberstam goes into the difficulties and techniques of gender studies - from 'nonce taxonomies' (pg8 - taken from *Epistemology of the Closet* by Eve K Sedgewick) to crafting new methodologies.

> [!quote] pg 8
> [...T]he production of new taxonomies [...], classifications of desire, physicality, and subjectivity that attempt to intervene in hegemonic processes of naming and defining. Nonce taxonomies are categories that we use daily to make sense of our worlds, but that work so well that we actually fail to recognise them.

She also engages the common issues of studying something that is, inherently, queer, and therefore defies singular definition.

> [!quote] pg 77
> The outsider, simply put, does not have access to the structures of social, sexual, and casual interaction that organize any sexual subculture.

To elaborate, earlier in the paragraph:

> [!quote] pg 77
> [... W]e might note that, when observed from the outside, even a contemporary lesbian community cannot be depicted accurately if the observer has no sense of the vernaculars of that culture or its hierarchies, gender codes, or sexual practices.
