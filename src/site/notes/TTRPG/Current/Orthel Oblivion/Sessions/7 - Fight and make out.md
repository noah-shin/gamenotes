### Summary

Ilfar Matron looking ill
The Matrons entered
Elerra and Sable dance
Elerra kicks out a Lar'Loth daughter from the ball - inappropriately invited by the Laval Matron, and claimed Fiore as a mate
Sable has a convo with Esdi, lmao very awkward
Esdi's poisoned most of the drinks with alcohol
Odessa and Esdi eye fuck and telepathically fuck for a bit
Esdi gets some air, gets stabbed by Beau

</div></div>



Initiative roll

Elerra can tell what's happened, can feel the cut actively happening, dragged up and into a circle around Esdi's stomach
The nearby guards look like they're straining, fighting to move
Elerra goes to Vortex Warps Beau into the centre of the room
Sable attempts Counter Spell
Elerra locks eyes with him, and forces negative Faerzress
Sable succeeds (after shennanigans)
Elerra then manipulates the Waters to jettison Esdi and Sable into the center of the room

Sable casts Darkness on Elerra's dress

Odessa heals herself of the poison
Summons her morningstar, and yells 'Halt - explain yourself'
Beau raises his hands in surrender and says: Fear is binding, only without it can we be free.

*hidden stuff was here*

Beau does nothing for his turn
Elerra casts Heat Metal on Sable
Odessa focuses on Elerra 'Stop.'
Elerra (through shrooms and a message) 'There have been many things I can forgive, but you causing violence within my home, when I invited you into _my_ home, my sanctuary, my place of safety, to my family. You would allow him to escape, [something else beautiful and threatening]. You would think me na√Øve? I will '
Elerra (only to Odessa) 'He has already lost my trust. If you take his side, you will lose it too, and you can't get it back.'
Odessa: I see the drow really are all the same. You deliver justice like this?
Elerra: This isn't vengeance. This is me being fed up of a world. 
Odessa: ...

Sable walks into the Darkness
Takes off his mask
Drops darkness
Walks up to Elerra
Presses the mask to her chest
Sable: I didn't intend for that to happen, I didn't know he was going to be here, I didn't think he'd hurt anyone, I didn't want to see anyone get hurt, and I thought you were gonna hurt him. I don't wanna see you get hurt, or Esdi get hurt, or him get hurt. Please don't let the hurt go on. 

Elerra was crying throughout the entire thing.
Elerra: If you didn't want people to get hurt, then you should've trusted me, to know that I'm not the kind of person to hurt somebody. Your lack of faith or trust in me is what puts this hurt on this field. Cause now you're exactly like every person who came before you.

Odessa walks forward, splaying a hand across Esdi's neck, casting Cure Wounds on the circular brands where they reach.
::spoilers Odessa can feel this Presence, a magical resonance where the sharran magic meet the runes::
The half carved matching circle on his stomach closes slightly, and his eyes flutter open.

Odessa steps forward, grabbing Beau by the back, digging the morningstar into his chin.
She whispers ::spoilers a different thirteenth truth into his ear::

Beau lowers his head, breaking his skin against the weapon.
He says: Pain is a lesson is a lesson. Only in suffering do we learn.
Odessa dismisses the weapon, grabs him by the throat, and hands him over to one of the guards.

The guards shackle him with simple cuffs but inscribed on the inside.
The moment they close, the illusion drops, and there is a matching brand that spans his back.
They escort him from the room.

Odessa orders the ballroom cleared.
Rocky, the Ilfar weaponmaster, hustles everyone out.
Doghym and DSL Matrons linger. Arcice are at the door, waiting to talk to Sable.

Avis had stepped forwards, Silvius in tow, to help Esdi up.
She looks unsurprised.
Odessa is also supporting Esdi, and Matron Lyszar also comes over, gesturing for a guard to come help.

Elerra doesn't take her eyes off Sable, but says: 'Silvius, can you please - escort Esdi to some support please.'
Silvius looks at Sable pointedly. Elerra minutely shakes her head.

Odessa brushes some blood off Esdi's cheek, casting Healing Hands on him.
Silvius, and Matron Lyszar escort him to safety elsewhere in the house.

Avis is lingering, not looking at Odessa, asks: You work for the La'val Matron, right?
O: Yes.
A: As a hired hand?
O: As a daughter in name.
Avis looks away from Esdi's retreating back to Odessa, mildly shocked.
A: They won't kill him, you know. They'll let him walk. I think something needs to be done.
O, not looking at Avis: Something will be done.
She doesn't look satisfied.
O: I'll be in touch.

Elerra raises her voice: If you do not belong to House Ilfar, this is your request to leave, before you are escorted out.

Everyone else begins to leave. 
LM and Doghym Matron move together as they all leave, stepping inside the wall of Speakers.
The Arcice Matron gives Sable a look as they pass to leave the ballroom.
Odessa also gives the AM a look as they pass her.

Eventually, the room is mostly cleared (the band probably still packing up at the far end).

---

Sable pulls the mask back a bit, pops the lens out, puts them back in his glasses, popping them back on.
Elerra takes a step back when he removes the mask.
Odessa parks up on a table edge.
Sable starts smoking.
S: I'm sorry?
S: I mean this with the most genuine sincerity - I was just scared and acted to protect somebody. I didn't do it in a way that would continue harm to you, and I _had_ a plan, but then everything kinda fell apart. I - I had an idea to make sure that nobody would get hurt. You - y - you kinda broke it. I understand I should've not done anything, but I can't not act - when I - when I see somebody who's important get attacked.

Elerra's face goes flat, and her mushroom link has shut down.

E: You didn't want anybody to get hurt, so you protected the person hurting someone? Esdi doesn't count?
S: No, I was - I was going to stop it. You got there faster, you were quicker, and you tried something and I didn't know what it was. I know you're a very capable person and I was worried about - what you could do.
E: How long have you known me?
S: In fairness, I don't think I've begun to actually understand who you are over the last few days.
E: That wasn't the question I asked.
S: A very long time.
E: Twenty years that you've known me. That we've had magic lessons that weren't really lessons, but us being friends. What exactly was your belief of my character, from all this time, that somebody you've known somebody for two days would be worth more than me. I stood up for you, I put my House and my life on the line for you, and you couldn't give me the benefit of the doubt, just once? I'd started to believe that I was important to you, and it appears that I was wrong. That transparency you demanded was bullshit. Don't linger on your way out.

Elerra begins to walk out.

O: The benefit of the doubt? What does that look like from you?
E: The benefit of the doubt? For him?
O: You may have had your 20 years, losses and revelations. But the concept of - of panicking? Reverting to base instincts, to base traumas, to the belief that you're the only person in the room - the only person who can _do_ anything, the only person with any power, the only person who can be _trusted_. 
O: Sure, Sable, you're a dumb shit that isn't worth the dirt you walk on
S: You're not wrong.
O: But there's something to you that's - enticing.
S: I mean what I just said - I don't want to see anybody else get hurt ever again. If I could do that? I would really prefer if the three of us could be there to do that together.
O: See, I think the issue here is your words, to me, mean jack shit cause I've known you for 48 hours and every other word out your mouth is a half-truth.
S: This is me trying to unlearn a _very_ long time of doing anything I could - _anything_ - to just . Breathe, and continue to be who I am. Believe me, I am trying - I really really am - but I can't make all that go away in an instant.
S: There isn't a spell that can fix all these problems.

Odessa pushes up from the pillar and steps closer to Elerra. (Jake vc: Oh no)
O: There isn't, but there's no reason to ... trust ... in order to ... have.
O: You don't have to push away these things, you don't have to throw and break things that aren't ... perfect.
O: Like him.
O: You liked him for a reason.

Sable looks nervously over his shoulder, then steps a little closer.
S: It's not a case of _liking_ him - there's a bit of an instinct, but that's no why I do these things. I think he could put me in a spot where I could - I could keep people safe, and I could ... stop all that hurting.
S: But I don't have any idea how to do it myself.
S: So I need him to actually pursue that. This wasn't some sudden desire to go after that man, he is just ... a very important tool.

Odessa steps behind Elerra, to her shoulder. (Jake vc: Oh fuck)
O: He's kind of cute when he's this desperate to not lose your favour. You don't have to give it, but you don't have to just kick him out into the cold.

Elerra just stares at Sable.
S: We can go talk to him together? And I can try and show you - I don't know if he'd listen to me, I hardly spent any time with him - but he -
S: I don't know if I can fully put it into words.
O: Try.
S: I think I found a way to kill God.

...

O: _A_ God, or the big Ao?
S: Mystra.
S: And I could - I could fix it. I could make things work the way they _should_ work. I can stop people from getting hurt!
S: But I need to find out more, I need to keep going down this rabbit hole.
O: And you think Shar's the way to do that?
S: Look, Shah is - I don't know if what I spent time with was Shar - but they told me they ... they certainly made me feel a connection.
...
S: I fucked God.

Sable is obviously kinda freaking out about it.

Odessa walks behind Elerra, to her other shoulder.
O: You could get him to do anything right now, get him to tell you _anything._
O: What do you want from him?
E: ...
O: Trust?
S: Good luck
E: Sailed.

E, to Sable: On your journey to killing God, to gain knowledge, which may or may not work, you think it's okay to hurt people for it?
S: No -
E: Because that's what you did. You may have good intentions but you're not even looking at the consequences? Or event the place in which you're at?
O, in an undertone to Elerra: He can't get away with this.
S: This me is different from even a few days ago, and I apologise for the harm I've caused - I didn't know what else to do.
E: I wasn't talking about the harm _before_ this.
S: Look, I was trying, like I said, I wasn't going to harm anyone here.
O, in an undertone to Elerra: He can't get away with the shit you can. (Jake vc: Wyrmtongue)
S: I will be honest to my fullest capacity - I don't want to hurt anyone.

E: In this new world that you want to create, you're going to be judge, jury, executioner. You're going to _be_ God, going to make the rules, decide how you want things to be?
Sable subconsciously immediately smiles at the thought.

S: Well, there's a lovely idea regarding the company you keep, make sure they're keeping you on the right track.

Odessa also steps out from behind Elerra, closer to Sable.
O: You've never heard of anyone resorting to violence to enforce an ideal? Do you not get to choose who gets what? Decide what people can and can't do?
O: Is an arrow in the back when they touch a chair enough? Seeing someone cast an unknown spell enough?
S: Mm.
O: Where your primal brain takes over because it's triggering all kinds of fight-or-flight and all he did was try and stop the fucking vortex, there was no _harm_.

E: The spell I was going to cast was simply to move them from the balcony. I was afraid he would trhow Esdi over the edge into the waters!
S: I was - I could have stopped him, but I didn't get a chance.
O, to Sable: Because you didn't trust - you didn't extend that faith to someone who's done nothing but help you.

E: Sorry, let me clarify something to you both. This is my home, and that somebody that you know brought _violence_ into my _home_. The last time there was violence in my home, there was no home left.
E: So if you think for one second that I'm going to trust someone's word that he _might_ know something - a man to 'help me achieve godhood', destroying and taking over the world, everyone's decisions are now mine, no one can harm another person except for _me_ - I get to choose.
E, to Odessa: Because that's what he's saying.
E: I am not, despite what you might believe, a violent person. I prefer discussions, but when I see somebody that I have known for five seconds stab someone that I've known for my _entire_ life, somebody that I grew up with, somebody who I know what they've been through? 
E: I was there when they came back, and you - you expect me to ask the a question to the person digging a _circle_ into their stomach? 
E: You want me to have the benefit of the doubt, this guy just might want to say hello? You know what, I was wrong. I should've tried to approach it calmly, not try to take the person with the _knife_ away from their victim?
E: You think somebody as _adept_ at magic as you would recognise that my spell wasn't harmful. Instead of trusting, you acted in a way that spoke to what you thought of my character.
E: This lack of trust Sable has towards me to do the right thing - to not kill somebody but to take them in for information.
E: Because that's what this boils down to.
E: I don't give a shit if Sable has a different optinion to me, if we have different views on what should happen or how we should approach things.
E: I invited you into me _home_. My sanctuary, my safety.
E: And instead of me, you went with somebody who brought _violence_ into that home.
E: I was never going to kill Beau.
E: And there are other things you could've done, that potentially allow somebody to get _murdered._

S: I don't know if this is news to you, but -
Sable starts rolling up his sleeves to show the glowing scars, pulls his glasses down.
S: I am a _horrible_ walking red flag of somebody who is not as adept as he likes to put across.
S: I don't know what I'm doing, sure.
S: But I'm trying. I'm really really trying.
S: I am aware, I was clearly making a mistake, but that is something to learn from.
S: I wish it could just be that.

E, to Odessa: You're right, I could request anything from him.
E, generally: The request I'm going to make, if we're partners in this endeavour, then we're _equal._
E: You don't get to hide shit, you don't get to lie, no hidden agendas or information.
E: And know that I will _always_ be checking, because there's little chance of you getting my trust back.
E: And if you _do_ trick me, or lie to me, or misinform me of intentions, I will hurt you. Badly.

Sable pushes his glasses back up.
S: I've played the numbers game before, and I will take my chances that we can make this work. To make it better - for me and for you - and that halfway flag over there.
E: Well, actions speak louder than words.

O: My first request -
(Sidebar - (Jake vc: God)(Noah vc: What have I done? What have I said to instil this?)(Jake vc: Sable's just worried)(Noah vc: What do you think I'm gonna say?)(Jake vc: Too much)
O: I want to speak to Beau.
S:  I would love that, please.
O: If Esdi is being targeted, I want to know why.
S: He'll be more responsive to me, but if you're both there, I think it'll be okay. It's just - I think the odds are better if I was talking.

E: We won't be able to go straight away - there are protocols and processes in place. You can either come back at a later time, or wait for a bit, somewhere none of the family would see you.
O: We could occupy ourselves on the balcony for the hour?
S: Waiting is much easier than going back, because I don't think I'll be getting away quite as easy.
O: I can keep the link active if you want?
E: That may be helpful. I have to deal with another matter from this evening, so stay on the balcony, out of sight.
O: I won't let him go anywhere.

Elerra walks away.
Sable, in an undertone but she still catches it: I hate how bad I am at talking to pretty people.
Elerra, unnoticed, falters for a step.

---

Zariah is rushing across the hall, heading towards the dungeons, when Elerra catches her.

E: Did you know what mom was doing?
Zariah stops, suddenly, looking Elerra over, worried for her.
Z: Your mother and I made a deal a long time ago.
E: Does dad now?
Z: He does, yes.
Z: It was when we first - when I first met your mother.
Z: We just wanted him to be _safe._ 
E: So you hid something from him, to protect him, and you thought that was okay?
Z: I fear that your father may have found out about it now.
Z: He thinks its - it spoils the art, spoils the performance. He wouldn't have continued with the fae dancing.
Z: We should have told him. We couldn't have told him. We didn't tell him and he found out.
Z: It's not - not a good 
E: You can't keep doing it.
Z: Yeah, we really can't keep doing it.
Z: This deal was made before your time, before you were born. There are just repercussions, you know?

Elerra steps aside, and her mom continues on the path down.
Her dad isn't in the house.
Her other mother is probably resting in her room.
Her brother probably left with the other dnacers.

Elerra heads to the bedroom, pulls herself back together, then grabs some books to bring to Sable.

---

Odessa heads to a balcony, and sits up on one of the ledges.
Sable begins chain smoking next to her.

There's some silence for a while.

Odessa slants a look over at him.
O: What happened? 
S: ?
O: When you fucked God.
S: He showed me a spell that I had never seen before. My understanding was that I was a battery, of some description?
S: To help him cast a spell, and when I tried to speak to him, it - it wasn't him.
S: It was Shar, and she called me out on a thing I had never spoken aloud until today. A dream, a ridiculously high ambition, that I didn't think I could ever do. I was content, before, to find small change, I made my peace with it.
S: When you get a chance to see what your potential could be?
S: You can't turn away from that. No matter how bad the numbers are, no matter how scary it could always be - don't you just wanna push your luck?

O: Are you after the Weave?
S: Yeah. Look, the Weave, the Weave is the most, or second most powerful thing that is out there. I know that raw magic has its own designs and purpose, but magic under our direction is just chaos.
S: If we had access to the Weave in its truest form, like Mystra, you can do _anything_.
S: You can pull the heavens from the sky. You can drag time to a stop. You can cast any wish you want.

O: What would your one Wish be?
S: I don't know.
O: Oh, don't give me that fucking bland 'I want to fix it, I want to save everyone.'
S: I want the violence to stop. That's it. No more hurt.
S: This is the form that it needs to take to make sure it happens.
O: Why don't you get rid of it?
S: And let that chaos, that raw magic loose? 
S: No, if that was an option, if there was any other option, it could've been done. I don't have all the facts, I have one little vision that I want to push for.

O: No, give me one, one specific wish. How would you word it?
S: One? I just want someone to look at me with true acceptance. With love. I want someone to embrace all of me when they smile.
O: Anyone? Or _someone_?
S: I don't typically like to dwell on it too much, that far through. I put the thought back into his little pit.
S: When you live in my situation, that pit needs to stay closed so you can keep moving.
S: If that answer changes, I will gladly let you know.

O: So you're going to become a god just to .. stop a person from dying?
S: It's also - so many people have been given a shit hand for no reason. We could change our entire reality, we can change how everything works.
S: These beings sit at the pinnacle of their power and they don't, they don't _act._ They demand monuments, their status, get bogged down by their own little policies.
S: The Weave is, in my opinion, the most powerful thing kicking.
S: If I have to kill Mystra to get to the Weave, I will. If I have to use the shadow, I will.

O: The shadow?
S: Mm - the power Beau showed me. The one thing that could be stronger than the Weave.
O: Not runic magic?
S: No, this is something that slips between reality. It can operate here, without any opposition. In a place like this, that's what makes him deadly.
S: In truth, if he wanted, he could act. And it doesn't matter what waters were present - he could just burn it all away.
S: If my understanding is correct, but then again, I don't exactly have the best track record.

O: No, I can understand why getting fucked by a God might -
S: We don't need to -
O: No, I like to say it. It's a good - not many people can make that claim.
O: In fact, I don't know how many could even claim to have talked to a God, never mind seeing one, never mind touching, never mind being _fucked_ by one.
S: You don't need to needle me like this. Not when Elerra isn't around.
O: Oh, this isn't needling, this is -
S: Genuine curiosity?
O: Yeah.
S: Are you running the numbers?
O: I never had the head for numbers. No - I'm bored, and I'm hungry, but I don't know what for.
S: Well, when everything is at your disposal, you can find your answer there. If that's ... enough to sate that hunger.
S: But of course, we won't know until we get there.
O: Oh, its not that. It's not power, or ambition, or blood lust. It's -
O: I don't know.
S: I really wish I could not know.

O: My personal condition is a ... messy one, and a fun like to live. I just thing that this business is kinda fucked up - the matching brands on the back there was kind of startling.
O: I couldn't really get my grasp of the Shar on Shar violence going on.
S: I don't think Esdi was ... an active member.
O: Hm. But to off him in the middle of the ball is to make a statement.
S: My thinking was that is was to discover components.
O: Blood?
S: Yeah, the hair is asked for before, that was part of the things present to -
O: To kill Mystra?
S: To speak to Shar.
O: I feel like she could, you know, just show up?
O: But maybe its to prove that you're worthy - do these arbitrary tasks for me and then I'll fulfil your request.
S: See, I would love to find out more, I would love to have these answers for you, but I can't get them without Beau - I can't even replicate what he did.

O: So did she say 'I know that you want to kill Mystra and here's how to do it?'
S: Okay, its no - its a little embarrassing, but there was not a lot of - she kind of told me what I wanted to hear and then - yeah.
S: We didn't really get a chance to talk.
S: Which, again, was what I was trying to organise with Beau when we got in here, but he was focused on Esdi.
O: Could be smarter with your choice of conduits.
S: I'm not that kind of smart.
O: You just imprinted like a ducking on the first guy that gave you great head.
S: Look.
O: And you decided he, he had a couple of secrets that you wanted and -
S: As a general thing ... when was the last time somebody ... somebody touched me without hurting me.
O: ...
S: That was the first genuine positive connective I have made in a _long_ time, so sorry, I gave in. I'm not exactly built of sterner stuff - I just wanted to be _held_ for a little bit, is that too much to ask?
O: How long?
S: I've lived basically my entire lifespan like that, so please.

O: Does the _love_ matter that much?
Odessa reaches over, and pulls him between her legs, where she still sits on the balcony ledge.
S: It's not exactly something I've had the most ... space to figure out.
S: If you weren't aware, I live most of my life on a leash. I don't really get to be alone, and when I can, I spend it with Elerra.
O: The relationship you have royally fucked up for the foreseeable time?
S: Yes, very much aware of that, thank you. You're an excellent reminder about these things.
O: You don't know what I'm about to say next.

Odessa traces the back of her hand, gentle, perhaps even lovingly, down the side of Sable's face, then rests the flat of her palm against his throat, against his collar.
Sable goes red.

O: I think that's the thing I don't get. You - you _had_ it. When was the _last_ time someone ever touched you gently? Someone, at some point, did love you, held you. And I - I don't see what's so good about it?
Sable weakly punches his leg, trying to get a handle on things.
S: In that horrible little moment where nothing goes your way, and you can't get yourself back up, and you can't figure out what you want, and you can't carry on with you are. It's something right there that will pick you up.
O: So it's a person that gives you purpose? Decides your morality?
S: Doesn't decide, more of a ... comfrot.
S: This is all very hypothetical, I can't lie to you. I just have a desperate desire to ... have it again.
O: Your ambition, to kill a god, for the mere sake of ... being held in a loving embrace?

Her hand turns from the throat to the back of his head, threading through the hair to cup his head.

O: Is this not enough?
Sable looks down, frantically thinking.
Odessa tugs where she is gripping his hair, to make him look at her.
Sable pulls forward and kisses her.

---

Elerra walks in, then to the balcony.
[jess vc: Im feeling a sudden way so, please take the floor.]
She meets Odessa's gaze, standing behind Sable.
E: This was about love?
(She had overheard the conversation from the convo about love through the shroom link)
E: Your world domination plan was over _love_?

Sable turns his head away, Odessa keeping her hand on the back of his neck.
S: I strongly disagree with the word domination.
S: I just want to, you know, meaning something _genuine_ to someone. Anyone, honestly. 

Elerra just looks at him, her expression clearly reading 'you are a dumb idiot'.

S: It's not the sole reason - I also want to end world hunger, wars, that kind of thing as well.
S: But I also want hugs.

E: Now this might sound a little crazy, so bear with me, and it's not the sole reason, we clarified that, but in your quest for love ... did you ever just stop to consider being yourself? Around somebody who cares for you?
E: I feel like that could've been a first step to this, it may have even changed the plans a little bit.
E: I just -

S: As you are much aware, I spend the majority of my day in a constant state of pain.
E: I'm aware of that, but I'm also aware that you have time away from him.
S: Very little, and you - you take up a lot of that time.
E: I see.
S: Not a lot of time to go out and -
E: I could have covered for you! Be your wing woman?
S: So I show up and be like 'Oh hey, what do you do for a living? Yeah, I live my life as someone's dog.'
S: That's not - I don't know how many people are
Odessa tightens her grip on the back of his neck, and his collar. Elerra catches the movement.
[jess vc: pls no scene pls no]
E: Some people are really into that, you know.
S: Sure they are, but I don't really want to make those kind of jumps.
S: If I can, you know, do a cool thing, kill god, and I can get hugs.
E: Another crazy thought, stick with me again - you ever just thought of asking somebody for a hug?

Elerra puts the books down, away from the balcony edge.
She steps forwards, catches them both in a large hug.
E: This is how you get a hug.
Odessa squeezes back, pats Elerra. Sable cries for a bit, then sits up, wipes his eyes.

S: I don't know how many times I have to say this, I'm not really a smart person.
E: I'm getting that.
S: Yeah, I have one field in which I have learned through trial and error, so forgive me if - if asking for a hug is a little bit beyond me.

She rests her chin on the top of his head.
E: We are going to call this a blank slate. What I said earlier still stands - if you want us in, you -
S: I won't lie, I won't tell a half truth, I will do what I can.
E: We can't help if we're in the dark. And we can't trust each other, if we're in the dark.
S: Okay.

She finally steps back to pick up the books, and hands them to Sable.
E: These aren't for you to keep, but they're personal tomes from her mother's library.
Elerra hesitates when handing over the last book.
E: This is on House Arcice. Its history, and information on House Vix'ro. I thought you might need some ammunition, when you return to Arcice.
E: And if you don't want to return there, there are other options.
S: Might to explore those.
S: In time - but I do want to read this.

O: There are other options, even if you do want to return.
S: I don't want anyone else to get hurt.
O: There are other options.
S: Like, what? You'll - you'll come along to make sure that the very dangerous woman doesn't blow me up?
O, mocking: Dangerous woman.
S: She is a Matron. Typically, that means a very consistent thing.
O: Typically.
S: I want to read this before I make any decisions like that. We - we can worry about that sort of power plan later.
O: Mm. It's just - the offer I made upon our first meeting still stands. I was - fuck - I was a hired hand before. I ... She's - she's not the most dangerous woman that ... that I've killed.
S: That conversation - I don't think we can have that anymore. I had a very different view of you.
O: Why not? Because I believe the agreement I made was to operate in some form of security, for free.
S: Mm. 100% truthful, you were to be a tool, a blade when I needed, a body to hide behind. Not really anything else.
O: ... As I said, the original agreement doesn't have to change.
S: I, I just don't, I just don't see you as a tool any more.
O: That's your fault.
S: Oh, well, like I've said, I'm more than willing to make mistakes and learn from them.
O: ... Feel free to read your book, make your decision, and choose what plan, and what weapon, you want to use.

Sable immediately walks off, clearly thinking 'not doing that, I'm not entertaining this.'

---

Elerra turns to Odessa, curious.
E: I heard the sound of a weapon, during the fight, and didn't get to see a weapon. Would you spar sometime? I think it would be ... a good education.

(Sable can fully still hear them)

O: I asked after training grounds and they gave me a patch of forest.
E: Oh, there's training grounds in the house.
O: If you have a spare weapon, then sure.
E: I don't get to see the one I heard earlier?

O smirks, and summons a rapier - elegant, black metal, with a hilt of intricate scroll work.

O: This one? I don't - I don't use it for that, not for training.
E: I can understand that.

Odessa holds it out to her, hilt first, so she can take it.
Elerra does a little spin with it, tests its balance. 

E: That is impressive.

Elerra passes it back, hilt first.
Odessa goes to take it, but her hand passes through as the blade turns to smoke and shadow. Instead, she reaches to clasp the outside of her arm, runs along to the elbow, pulls Elerra closer.
Des tucks a piece of hair behind Elerra's ear.
[Jess vc: when the hand pops up on screen / that slutty little hand]
(In the background, Sable is walking back and forth, trying to read very quickly, but frequently glancing up at the pair, blushing, and going back to reading.)

O: Sable is desperate, he's easy to read.
O: I'm far more hesitant with overstepping with you.
E, under her breath: [Something in Irish - meaning 'I like it']
O: I know that this is reciprocated, but I'd appreciate ... clarity for my next steps.
E, quietly: If you were to ever overstep, let me be very clear - 
Odessa can feel the point of a dagger on the inside of her thigh.
[jess vc: is that / is that a dagger in your pocket]
E: I have ways of indicating if I wasn't interested.
And Elerra pulls Odessa in for a kiss.
