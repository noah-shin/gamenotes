Odessa turns up - punctual to early, dressed in a set of ornamental La'val armour, arriving in a carriage
Sable arrived a little late, hurried.
White cat somewhere in the dressing room we're led to - belonging to Betty, the seamstress, called Bobble.
Elerra is sat, styling her hair.

Reveals our two outfits

Odessa heads behind the screen to change.
Odessa suggests two alterations - incorporation of the breastplate, and to continue wearing the armoured legs.
She's getting the adjustments from Betty as the other two are in the back.
Sable goes to get the snack food - and realises the cat is an animated cat made of cloth!

Elerra shows Sable his outfit
Odessa switches back to her armour undershirt
Goes to Sable
Asks to see his forearms - still unhealed
Starts to unwrap the bandages
	In the scars are a glowing series of intricate lines running up the arm, up past the sleeve.

Odessa places a gentle touch at the top of his forearm
Then looks at Elerra
O: I can heal him fully, but I have something to confess.

Elerra dismisses Betty

Odessa confesses her worship of Lolth - in round about terms - believing that actions and use is more important than the source of her power.
Elerra nods, acknowledges that, and agrees that the use - if for healing - should be fine.

Odessa uses lay on hands to heal both arms, moving almost reverently.

Sable: The last few days have been eye opening in receiving care. So thank you. This is probably the most that anyone has ever done for me. Between the clothes and the healing - thank you.
S: I'm sorry I wasn't exactly the most transparent with my interactions with the rune, and I plan to change that going forward.
Elerra: The thing about actions of care is that they don't require a thank you, and don't require anything in return.

As Sable changes, the teal glow is so intense from the lines that you can see it across his whole body.

Odessa to Elerra: Thank you for the generosity, the clothes are, as much as you, utterly beautiful.
Elerra: Pretty clothes for pretty people.

Sable comes from behind the screen - holding Odessa's white overshirt, clothes not worn quite properly.
Odessa tells him to keep the shirt.
Elerra positions Sable infront of the mirror, and systematically straightens out his outfit.

Sable goes to switch out the glasses for the mask, but stumbles as he cannot see
Elerra goes over to help switch the lens over - moving Sable's head with two fingers.
Then places the mask on for him.
Sable, voice nearly cracking: It looks really nice, th-thank you.

Sable: I'm kinda upset as to how much thinking time you two take up.

Elerra - 120 (25)
Sable - 139 (28)
Odessa - 66 (27)

Odessa offers a game - share a secret and get asked a question
Everyone agrees.

Elerra unconsciously sits up a little straighter.
E: This is technically not a secret that no-one knows, but is one of the most highly kept secret that I have. What do you know of the Order of my siblings (we are triplets) birth?
Sable knows that the brother is the eldest, then the sister, then Elerra.
E: That's not actually correct. I am the eldest, the Heir to House Ilfar. We have falsified the order to protect me, so that people are less likely to dispose me. A burden and risk they have taken on for me.
Odessa didn't know about the siblings.
E: You probably haven't met them - my brother loves his magic, and my sister spends her time with her husband and children. (Fiore and Lise)

Odessa reveals the ring on her finger
O: Meet Cassara xund Ilarâ€™as of House La'val
Elerra: The eldest daughter of House La'val who never returned from your Blooding.
O reveals the ring - about Cassara, the telepathic communication, and the mental blocking.
E: I had been informed of your involvement, in some capacity, with the death of La'val. I had wanted to know how you went from being nowhere to becoming so important to the House.

S: When I was younger, and filled with a lot more spite than I am, I wanted to find a way to break some rules on how magic works. I wanted to find my own little back-pass and break the rules everyone else follows, so I could exploit them, and I could cheat. I succeeded, but at a small price. One - the Mark. Two - my sight has been gifted an alternative perception. I see things that happen, that don't, that are conceived of. They are messy and jumbled, so the glasses help me focus. They are from me being reckless, and not thinking things through.

Insight check - he's holding back on the more intricate details of what actually happened, and the amount of damage caused.

S to O: Why did you offer me help for free, then end up attached on the hip with one of the most powerful wizard I've ever seen?
O reveals their role in the Blooding, the fact that they are of, but not part of, the House. So they turned up at Orthel alone, and reuniting with the La'val Matron is because they are the two of the last.

O: I was a child, locked in a room, because I was born with wings instead of horns. I petitioned House La'val because they had the most opportunity.

Sable asks Elerra: The mushrooms - you can turn them off?
Elerra: It's a skill that was taught to me from childhood, from before I was spored, so that I could have my secrets.
Sable: How does it work??
Elerra: There's no mechanism, but it's like a clear mind plane, a place you can go to, that describes you at your core, and is stronger if you're truthful with yourself and allow it to be as it is, rather than forcing it to be something else. Within, you build protection, you build walls, traps, doors. You can ground yourself and allow just a sliver of that energy to enter your space, or close them all. It seems simplistic, but it does involve mental awareness and stamina in order to maintain it, unless sustaining it feels like second nature.

E: I could teach you?
S: There are variables there that I do not -

E to O: With your position in the House, how far would you adhere to the orders of the Matron? What would be the line that you wouldn't cross? 
O: I never follow her because its her. The line is my own moral one, which is always hard to distinguish. 
E: Do you aim to use this city as a new start then?
O: Time only ever moves forward. I have no desire to repeat the sins of my predecessors.

Elerra puts Sable's mask back on him so he can see, and she can look him in the eye.
E to S, quite blunt: Does your desire for vengeance and rebellion, particularly to House Arcice, have anything to do with House Vix'ro?
Sable turns slightly, and she moves his head back. He is visibly very shaken.

S: Nobody has said that name in a while. 
S: That was mine .. and they were all taken away.
S: I got angry, and have a singular rule - from them taking away my family. It's all from them.
He's very upset and very genuine.

S: How do you know about this?
E: The history of House Arcice and its escapades have been truly well researched and documented for the past twenty years, when Gwynn started showing an interest that would not quit. One of my parents decided that, if they were interested in joining our family, who it was exactly that wanted to join. Who they were, where they came from, where they started, who their business partners once were. Your House has not been wiped from the records as much as you thought it was.
S: That's almost regrettable. I think - I'd rather people not know how little were are, or have ceased to be, or how someone who walks around on a leash is ...
E: A House is never truly dead, if its descendants are truly alive.
O: This isn't my question, but are you speaking from experience?
E: My questions earlier, about if you would repeat the actions of House La'val, were not coming from a purely city-focused standpoint. There was a time where House La'val was believed to have potentially House Ilfar to the point where only my mother remained. We are proof that a House can be rebuilt, and why we are so protective of our secrets and truth. We once saw our House burned to the ground.
Odessa looks a lil ashamed: All I knew was that it was a House from my city, and was long before my time.
E: In the end, it is my House's history. One that we came back from, one that shaped us, and why I received such ... strong warnings about you. About your intentions within the city.
E: We have a belief in the House that people are allowed to have histories and pasts, but it is their future and their actions that define them. Not the House they were born to but how they behave that determines whether they are worth knowing or worth walking away from.

O to S: How do you avoid divination magic?
Sable taps where the collar would be.
S: Being hidden away is where I like to be. My only key to privacy.
O: You'd almost think such a thing would be the opposite.
S: I don't think Gwynn is fully aware, but here we are, the key to get away and free from any pursuit, even as it is a symbol of his hold on me.

O to E: Why does your Matron come into the public view so rarely?
E: She doesn't leave the House often, for the reason I stated earlier. She was an only child, and was not allowed to leave much. Heavily protected, as the Heir. The only time she left, she returned to a House destroyed. So she doesn't like to leave it now. And she really loves reading, honestly.
E: The only reason I'm allowed to leave is because I have siblings, and my real position is hidden.

Betty returns
We all dress, get our hair and makeup done.

Elerra's dress - she asks for someone to help tie her corset up.
Odessa looks over at Sable, egging him on.
He steps forward, and realises he doesn't really know how to do it.
His hands go to her waist, hesitant, before slowly and carefully lacing it up.

Betty can sense the atmosphere. 
Odessa winks at her and she smiles.

### Act 1 of the Ball

People start arriving, some early, most on time.

We are led to the Ballroom, through the main portion of the House. The entrance hall opens into a large central hall with a series of flowing series of stairs that lead to the Ballroom.
The place is gorgeously decorated, in their usual silver, glass, and blue, alongside less usual pinks.
A large room with open arches, and the Weeping Waters flow over either side of the room down to a lake below it, that can be seen through a large glass floor. Dancers are spinning from the drapes, teleporting throughout the room.

Elerra enters first, and is loudly announced.

At the front of the ballroom is the Ilfar Matron - Lynae - in a delicately embroidered white suit - greeting those who enter.
House Do'ghym are already there - five hooded silver-masked figures, along with the weaponmaster (Arnet), Matron (Olandra), and only child (Avas). 

Sable and Odessa enter after a couple others pass through, unannounced.

Notice some people who probably shouldn't be here - also unannounced (or maybe just appeared), but cannot be called out because everyone is wearing masks - Sable can see Beau in one of the balconies.
He's in a gold chain harness attached from a gold choker, with some sheer pink layers for a skirt, and a simple gold mask.
It doesn't look like that he's clocked Sable, but perhaps intensely aware of Ezdi.

Sable: Sorry, Odessa. I have to go deal with something personal.
Sable casts Invisibility, heads behind Beau, and drops it.
S: Can I talk to you?
B: You know, its considered rude to steal from a lover less than an hour after the act.
Sable is blushing.
S: I didn't want to wake you, but I'll pay you back for it at some point. I do need to talk to you.
Beau steps a little closer, finally looking away from Ezdi, placing a hand on his shoulder.
B: Don't worry about it, we used each other, you were a lovely little conduit.
S: I need to do it again.
B: The magic ... or?
S: The magic. But ... I'm not complaining.
B: I'd love to. It's never happened before, and I'd love for it to happen again.
S: I need you to teach me how to do it.
B: Of course. I can teach you everything I know. We may have to leave the city for some of it, but you probably don't have anything else going on, right?
S: I have some things to deal with, but we could sort it out.
B: We? You expecting me to help with something?
S: You seemed very willing to help before.
B: You still stole from me. 
S: I don't think you're that upset about that.
B: We'll see how upset about that I am. Later, maybe.
S: I know where to find you, so. I'll leave you to it.
B: I'm here all night.

Beau refocuses on Ezdi, a little less intensely.

Elerra goes to talk to the Auvryath kid (Silvius, only son) (golden draconic eyes, black scales rimming his face, black and silver with hints of purple cloak, hint of silver armour underneath) she recognises.
He's talking with Ezdi (Lyszar son) (thin white ruffled shirt) and only Do'ghym daughter (Avas) (intimidating, tall, white buzzcut, red eyes heavily pierced, simple black dress, open back to reveal a row of corset piercings that go up to her neck). 
The three of them are close friends, allowing Elerra in with her friendship with Silvius.

The four have some small talk.
Odessa joins - heading for Ezdi and Elerra after Sable ditches her.
O: I do hope I'm not interrupting.
There's a cough, and the Lyzar Matron (Fian) (simply dressed, emerald motif) clears her throat, looking at Odessa quite firmly. Ezdi turns to her, away from Odessa. Down his spine, she can see a huge blackened burn, almost like a brand, from under the hair and down the entire spine.
Elerra knows that, and Odessa recognises that, the imagery and symbols are associated with Shar. 
Ezdi: Not at all.
He goes and introduces everyone. 
Odessa lets her pleasure and excitement through.
There's a flash of our previous meeting (the suggestive stuff) that slams back down - everyone in the group registers it. Silvius doesn't react, Avas smiles slightly, Elerra giggles.

Sable looks lost, before spotting Odessa and Elerra, heading to them, obviously looking back at Beau.
He, in practiced form, standing a little behind the pair of them, head down.
Ezdi notices him - Odessa introduces him. We cut him off from elaborating, and he invites Sable in.

Odessa offers him her lap, and he's on autopilot and takes it.
She places a hand on his lower back, trying to be reassuring.
Sable doesn't pick up on any tension or untoward attention. Ezdi looks curious, doesn't comment. The other two are pretty inscrutable. Elerra has a polite mask.

Elerra: Be careful not to wrinkle the fabrics, they took a lot of time to prepare.
The rest take us in, then lean in conspiratorially.
Ezdi pulls out a gold flask: This is better, I promise. It's called Hag's Spit. What do you say we put some of this in the punch?
Sable knows its a drink that you don't find in the city - the closest market that would sell it is Greyrock. It's a very strong moonshine that tastes like apples.
Ezdi takes a swig, then passes it to Odessa, who notices its already half empty.
Odessa takes a swig, and gets the impression that you could pass out from a shot, then gives Sable a shot, still holding the flask.
Odessa holds it out to Elerra, but quirks an eyebrow as though as asking if she wants the same treatment.
She nods, and Odessa holds it out over the table, pouring it in her mouth.
Odessa gives Silvius the same unspoken question. 
She can read a weird tension there - a history between Silvius and Elerra? A little bit of a clenched jaw at the scene, watching Elerra.
Silvius declines the drink.
Same offer to Avas.
She levels Odessa with a look, then looks at Ezdi. 
In a muted tone, long-suffering, goes: Yeah.
Odessa just offers the flask to her, and she tastes a sip.
Ezdi takes the flask back and shoves it back into his shirt.

Sable looks over his shoulder, then looks back, very red and suddenly tense.
Odessa catches the sight of Beau, hip cocked against a pillar, looking quite pleased with himself.

The Arcices approach the table - the Matron (Gauslia) (stiff gold dress) - and doesn't quite recognise Sable.
Gauslia: Everyone having a good time over here? 
Elerra: I believe your table is to the top left. If you need assistance in finding it, I'm sure one of the guards would happily escort you.
Gauslia looks panicked at the idea of a guard being summoned over at it, and walks away.
Elerra: Hope you enjoy the show!
Gauslia: Hm. Quite.

People begin to sit, moving away from the main dancefloor, as the drapes begin to fall to spin to the ground.
The Matrons arrive at last.
Shavlyl Matron is dressed simply, silver bun, same ornate huge sword on her hip, suit with black chain and silver accents, simple black mask.
Desor Matron is dressed very flashily, silver armoured bodice with gold accents, deep red robe, super large silver headpiece with huge horns with dangling jewelry that covers the upper half of her face.
Ilar'as is dressed in a floaty fragile dress of gold chains spun with pearls to looks like lace spiderwebs, and a mask with long dangling chains.
They draw attention as the lights dim and the performance starts.
