E drops off mom, then goes back to her room
She starts to open the door, and Beau-Shar dissapears 
> Sable's hands are black and bloody, glass shards still in his hands, the black ash clumping in the wounds.
> He feels poured out, emptied of everything.
> For once, everything is clear - he can hear and see clearly

E in doorway for a moment, in disbelief, before stepping in
E: You couldn't have put a rug down first?
S: W - what?
S: Can you say that again? (He's processing the clarity)

S gets up and starts pacing, blood still dripping from his hands. (His glasses are on the floor)
E casts Cure Wounds on his hands (11HP)
> It looks like water freezes over the wounds to protect it, before glowing sea green, and the skin is healed.
> His bones shift back into place, glass falling out, before healing.

S goes to stare at the Waters through the window
S: The Waters are really loud. Are they - are they normally that loud?
E: ... Yeah?

S goes to cast Firebolt against the wall - nothing happens
> Where the Weave normally is, there's nothing there

S tries to cast Shocking Grasp, once again, nothing happens
He goes through all his spells, and nothing happens for any of them
At the end, he just punches the wall

E: Seriously, Sable - what's, what's going on?
S: I'm - it's okay
E: You don't seem okay
S: It's a developing situation -

S: Nothing is working. At all.
E: What's not working?
S picks up his glasses and puts them in a pocket.
S: I can see and hear fine - I'm not hearing everything else. It's normally a lot, and I have to focus a lot to get what you're saying. But now - now - it's gone. It's empty. 
S: But everything else is also empty?
E: Do you need to sleep it off?
S: This is a different kind of empty
E: What had you done, right before this?
S: The orb - Odessa took it, and I took it from Odessa.
S: I had a series of backup plans, but never got round to them.
S: I tried to eat the orb.
E: ...
S: Like the rune - the one that nearly got me
E: And me -
S: Killed. I thought this was a safe place, so I'd try it again here.
S: And then things went to black, and Beau-Shar - the God and Beau being the same thing - appeared. We said a couple things, I asked really nicely to eat the magic - I tried to pray
S: I offered Shar my time and devotion as a friend, as a loyal companion

E: And Shar didn't take your deal?
S: I can't tell if they did or not
E: [Stuff I will add later because Lauren had some clever stuff about magic there]

S: I have never willingly made a deal with anybody

Sable proceeds to run down on the rest of the sequences
E, through Arcana, feels like the powder feels like the Faezress - like the absence of the Weave
Thinks that it could be the powder in Sable's bloodstream that is blocking his access to the Weave

E: Do you have any kinds of magic that are not Weave based?
S: Technically?
E: Can you try it?
S: I don't know any runes well enough to do that - I know how to make one and how to turn one off, but not do anything with it.

E: Right. There's an ensuite bathroom - go wash the powder off, and I'll find you something to wear.
S: ...
S: *Oh*, right now? Right.

He heads off to shower

---

She notices the shadows in her room seem longer, the waters outside sound closer to wailing, the atmosphere seems changed 
Elerra tries to destroy the water in the dust
The powder isn't destroyed, but flows into one of the shadows and disappears

E casts message to the shadows: Come here often? Been here long?
The winds from the Waters picks up and the dust all fully disappears - she can sense a presence, but it could just be residual

---

In the mirror behind Sable, Shar suddenly appears
Sable flinches, but doesn't turn, focused on the reflection
S: Is this some kind of punishment?
BS tilts their head, still smiling softly

E, from the other room, to the air: I've never heard of dick so good that you claim it

Shar laughs a bit
BS: I like that one too. You're all great.
But Sable still feels watched.

Sable storms out the bathroom, repeating: We're all great.
S: Thank you? Weird way to piss off a god, but Shar - we're all great. Shar likes you too.
S: And language - there's a relationship there, between Shar and Odessa.
E: You only just got that?

Sable feels phantom hands on his waist, a chin hooked over his shoulder (as he felt it before).
Sable reaches back, can't feel hands there - but the hands on his waist don't disappear.
S: Okay - oh no. I think Shar's paying a lot of attention to me.

Sable wants to get Odessa out now
E: We need magic because we fucked up so badly, and you don't have any and I'm out.
E: You can sleep here - we can figure out what to do with Odessa tomorrow.

S: I feel like you want to punch me
S: If it would help you get it out of your system
E: I have more fun ways to cause harm
E: Just go to sleep

Shar's presence does fade away as Sable heads into the bedroom proper

---

Odessa was shackled and her gear removed
She doesn't do anything - then after 15/20 min, a group of 5 figures in black to blue flowing robes with the House Ilfar sigil as a clasp
They head to Beau's cell to investigate the dust
> Odessa overhears conversation about 'wizard stuff'. These are the House Wizards, specialised in the Faezress and Water-based magic.
> There's an occasional flash of white as they try to cast things that don't work.
> The tone is generally confused.
> A lady with short choppy white hair steps up after an hour, sighs, before going to call someone from Yor'faern in the morning (the mage academy).
> She glances at Odessa, with half a thought, before leaving.

Before sleeping, Odessa goes through her prayers to her associated pantheon - but there's a familiar emptiness.

Halfway through the night, she's woken by the sound of voices - one of the guards speaking to the Sister.
There's the rattle of keys and the opening of a cell.
Odessa hides, rolling to her feet.
There are only two guards in the room - one half-asleep at the reception, the other opening the sister's cell and leading her out.
Guard: I'm gonna trust you on this one.

Odessa tries to summon her Pact Weapon - but only gets halfway before it dematerialises.

There's a hard knock sound, like bone on bone, before the guard stumbles back onto the ground.
Odessa steps forward, no longer hidden.
The sister smiles a little
Sister: I would've liked to have killed him myself. But thank you, I'm sure Shar would be pleased.
Odessa: I'm sure she would be. Your strength of devotion is inspiring.
The sister steps a little closer.
Sister: So you agree then, he was a traitor?
Des: He was so very eager to spill. You meant a lot to him - a pity, his devotion to the wrong thing.
Sister: What would you do if I got the keys and let you out?
Des: Not much. There's still work here for me.
Des: But I'd appreciate just refastening my cuffs infront of me.
The sister hesitates, under a time pressure, her cuffs also still cuffed. She goes to grab the keys from the reception, then kicks them into Odessa's cell.

Des immediately unlocks her hands, and in her head: Can I kill her?
There's an overwhelming heavy presence behind Odessa
Shar: This one belongs to one of my Patrons.
Odessa unlocks the cell door
Odessa to Shar: They can stand to experience a bit of loss.
Odessa materialises a sword as the sister sweeps the dust into the air with a foot, breathes in
Des doesn't breathe in, but winks at the sister, who smirks.

Des locks herself back up and goes back to sleep.

---

Sable and Elerra wake up, then decide to stealth up to the tower before MD wakes up
It becomes immediately apparent that something went wrong.
Both guards are still breathing, just unconscious.

Elerra hangs the keys back up
Sable is staring at Odessa with a thousand yard stare, face against the bars

They stealth back to their room - and hear some movement from one of the spare bedrooms
Ezdi, sleepy, stumbles out of the room
Elerra steps out to meet him
El: Ezdi, you - you need to rest, what are you doing, wandering about?
Ezdi startles, before waiting for the noise to settle
Ezdi, whispering: I just needed to get out of there for a minute - my mother. I just wanted to go stand on the bridge.

Elerra can tell that he didn't sleep, but he isn't lying.
El knows that he's resentful of the attention that he gets now because of the Shar stuff

They head to the bridge together, leaving Sable in the bedroom
El prays a little to the Waters
Ezdi: I recognised him, you know. The guy from the ball, but I don't remember where from.
Elerra tells him what Beau told us - about the temple, about the job.
He gets increasingly upset, but doesn't remember anything more - sad about this information being taken from him
She gives him a line about the Waters ('it doesn't matter where the water's been, its about the journey to where it's going, and as long as it keeps flowing the past doesn't matter.)
Ezdi shares that he's upset that he's no longer sad about his brother. That he can't remember the loss.

Ezdi's brother and Silvius (one of House Auvryath) had been up in a dragon cave. He had fallen from a great height.

El: What do you think of Sable?
Ezdi: He's ... um. He's just a bit - I mean I saw - He's House Arcice, right? He showed me his mask, and that was horrible. Have you tried it? You looked close, and not close.
Ezdi: I enjoy a good time, but that mask - I saw _everything._ Three versions, at least three, of everyone in the ballroom. That was the worst time I've ever had - or the worst time that I remember having in my life. Do you know whats going on with that?
El: No, he - he keeps things close to the chest, so it's always interesting to see what other's see of him from a different perspective.

El: What did you think about Odessa?
Ezdi leans back into his alcove, flushing a little. 
Ezdi: Yeah, she's great! I'm - yep! Where is she?
El: Currently she's in the cells because she killed Beau.
Ezdi: Wooooow. Okay. Wow.
Ezdi flushes a little more.

Ezdi: Do we need to help get her out?
El: I'll help the MD in a bit, it's why I'm awake.
Ezdi ticks his head, listening to the shrooms.
Ezdi: Murder in the city is punished with exile, both from the city and from the myconid colonies.
Ezdi: It feels like the Sovereign is ... aware.
Ezdi: The Sovereign has requested an audience with Odessa.
Ezdi: I've spoken with him maybe five times directly. That's a lot. 

El: Would the Sovereign drop this against Odessa if he got something else that he wanted?
Ezdi: Like what?
El: There's been something he's wanted from House Ilfar for a long time. If he were to be granted that, would that appease his ... curiosity or need to punish Odessa.
Ezdi gasps, thinking he's got it.
Ezdi: You don't mean .... Really?
El: It's not something I would joke about, no.
El: How long before he would want to see her?
Ezdi: The Wyn'vri Matrons have been summoned. The audience will go ahead today, the Matrons have been invited.

---

Sable pulls out the books, going for references to Shar / Weave, as though he was studying
Then goes to sit in the ominous shadows.

A hand is placed on one of the books, to stop the flicking.
BS laughs: You're not going to find anything in here. What are you doing?
S: I'm not trying to find anything in here - I'm trying to get you out.
BS: I'm out. What can I do for you Sable?
S: How do I fix this (gesturing to his hands).
BS: There's no fixing this. It's a punishment.
S: If this is supposed to be a working relationship -
BS: That would imply we're on the same level
S: You were the one asking for my help.
BS: Was I?
S: It felt like it.
BS: It felt like a lot of things.
BS: You're going to want to go to my tent, find a black book covered in spikes under the table. 

S: Your sister is gone. Would she take it?
BS: Do you want me to stop her from taking it?
S: That would do me a lot of favours.
BS: What would you give me? That I don't already have.
S: I don't want to overstep, but half the stuff you put out into this city ends up dead in a cage or betraying your own church. 
BS: A consistent buddy? That's not going to do it for me. You belong to me. You are mine.
BS: What is getting your magic back worth to you?
S: It's literally my life and soul.
BS: Sad life, really
S: I'm aware. But here we are.

BS: Let me paint you a picture. My sister is on her way to the tent, where she will take that book and leave the city. That book is your only shot at getting that magic back. What can you give me in exchange?
S: I am a man of few possessions.
BS: I know. It's a sad sad life.
S: I have links to some more important people in this culture.
BS: Who?
S: Elerra would be great for you, no?
BS: Hmm. I knew we were going to work great together. I like that - I like that you would offer a friend of 20 years. I accept.

BS claps his hands together and disappears.

A couple hours later, a healer (Mint - a tiefling) comes out to escort Ezdi back into the bedroom
MD then walks out - heading towards the dungeons, less angry than last night.
Elerra drops into step next to her, as though it was a normal morning.
MD stops, turns to her.
MD: Good morning Elerra. Where do you think you're going?
El: Morning training, like every day? You hadn't said it was cancelled, and the cells could wait.
MD: Unfortunately this is not a normal day. I have to deal with the prisoner first. The Sovereign contacted me, it is urgent.
El: The Sovereign contacted you? Why?
MD: The Sovereign wants an audience with the prisoner.
El: The Sovereign never wants an audience with anyone?
MD: I was just as shocked, but who am I to question the Sovereign?
MD: Odessa's Matrons have been summoned, and will be here soon. Once they've arrived, we will all go visit the Sovereign, as requested. I wanted to get a few questions in, before. Just so I can paint a better picture.
El: Just questions?
MD: Yes.
> El knows that MD doesn't kill, but there are worse things that one could do. But the MD is telling the truth.

El: I can't really practice in my room, can I just do them at the bottom of the cells?
The MD concedes: It shouldn't take long.

---

At the bottom of the stairs, Lance is waiting. The pair head up, whilst Elerra stays downstairs, listening.
Odessa is still asleep.
MD and Lance walk in - Lance gasps before yelling for the guards, which startles Odessa and the receptionist guard awake.

The house is in lockdown again.
Guards fill out everywhere.
Odessa nearly bashes her knee as she rolls off the bench and to the cell door, before shrugging almost helplessly at MD.
The MD stalks forward, the air getting colder.
MD: What happened?
O: Why should I tell you? Not that I'm opposed, just, what's in it for me?

The MD is *barely* holding onto her temper.
MD: If you don't, I won't *kill* you, but you'll wish I had.
O: Counter offer, tie my hands infront of me and I'll tell you what happened last night.
MD: You are not in the position to make bargains.
The floor turns to ice, freezing her shoes, creeping up her legs, freezing her to the bone.

O: Sure, but I can state my desires.
The ice spreads to the knees, encasing her legs, spikes beginning to dig into the flesh of her calf.

MD: Start from the beginning
Odessa starts to tell the tale of her childhood like a fairytale.
The ice continues to spread, and the spikes grow deeper once Odessa reaches her parents.

Odessa finally reveals that she did it of her own free will
The ice retracts, but that also hurts
