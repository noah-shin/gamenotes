> ![lastSession#Summary]


The first dance starts
- Dancers spinning from the ceiling
- Begin _fade dancing_
- Flowing outfits as they begin to teleport through the silks
- (Elerra notices that her brother is ready in the background and her father leads the performance)

The dance ends, and a spotlight on the two long tables at the back - where the Matron stands
Matron: Good evening and welcome to House Ilfar. It is our honour to welcome -
she gestures towards the door, where my Matrons stand
Matron: Welcome the Matrons La'val, Desor, and Shavlyl. We hope your evening and please accept our apology on behalf of the Sovereign for your _harrowing_ week. Please understand that these actions do not reflect us, but the actions of a misguided man.

(Elerra notices that her mother (Matron) looks a little weaker as the lights come back up - a little withered?)
(Also knows that Lorian has clocked that, and approaching her to address that)

Odessa heads to the Matrons
Desor Matrons starts mingling, La'val and Shavlyl stay at the entrance
Odessa behind La'val's shoulder (providing details, introductions, keeping an eye out - nat 20 insight lmao)
Arcice approaches first - small talk about the La'val Matron's healing
	Bad intentions - shmoozing type
The other Matrons and some others do approach as well
	Most people have a similar intention
Auvryath Matrons (Elessaryn and Lisriel (Mother Superior of House Auvryath)) approach
	Odessa gets nothing from them
	More of an assessment, not after anything
	Can tell Lisriel and La'val do _not_ like each other
Do'ghym Matron does not approach
	But shares a look with the La'val Matron

---

Cause Odessa had to make Sable stand up, Elerra asks him to dance
He automatically follows her
She dances beautifully - even makes it look like Sable is leading
Then whispers something in his ear

Elerra then proceeds to dance with various heirs

First is Silvius - almost expectant
	S: I'm surprised Gwynn didn't show up anyway
	E: Sometimes all it takes is a strong word, and even the strongest of minds bend
	S (whispering): Did you really make him piss his pants?
	E (giggles): It wouldn't be a strong word if he wasn't scared enough to piss

Elerra suddenly spins away, like its part of the dance
	Silvius clocks on, and lets it happen

In the corner of the room, where the dancers are mingling
	Fiore (Elerra's brother) has been rather aggressively approached by a woman in a white dress, silver detailing, white half-skull mask, short severe bright-red hair, skeleton tattoos from hand to elbow
	She's clutching his arm slightly too tight

Elerra spins, falling into the woman, as though she had just lost control
There's a skull tattoo on the woman's face, under her mask
E: Oh I'm sorry, I hope I didn't spill your drink!
E (clocking an eye with a guard, and calling a server over): Are you new here? I don't remember your name?
Elerra can see that the grasp left near-claw marks, and subtly cure wounds the injury

The woman extends a hand
W: Sorry, I was invited by the House La'val matron. My name is Ikara, from House Lar'loth.
Elerra leans forward, not taking the hand.
E: Sorry, that invitation didn't have a plus one, so you _are_ going to have to leave.
E: And if I ever find out that you've clawed my brother again, you're going to wish you hadn't even thought to be in his presence.
Elerra locks eyes with a guard to get her escorted away.
The woman just tries to lock eyes with Fiore again, and Elerra takes her face to make her look away.
Fiore reaches out, and takes Elerra's elbow before she can do anything more than touch the woman's face.

Elerra lets the woman get escorted out, shooting a look at the La'val Matron
The La'val Matron looks over as the woman is escorted by the guard across the room
	Shooting Elerra a knowing look
Then LM heads towards Ikara - putting herself between the guard and the door
	LM: What's happened?
Elerra shoots a message to Odessa, explaining the situation
E: If your Matron stops her from leaving, I will also have her escorted out. I don't play with my family, you don't touch them. You don't involve them.

Odessa clocks the fact that Ikara's actions were that of a possessive woman staking a claim on a male, or an assessment of breeding stock.

LM starts reaching out to the guard, between his armour
Odessa whispers that information into LM's ear, shooting a look at Ikara
LM retracts her hand, stepping away to let the pair leave.

Odessa clocks that the Lar'loth Matron and other daughter are also in the ball

---

Elerra turns to face Fiore after Ikara has been led away
Fiore immediately puts his hands up
	F: I do not know what to tell you
	E: Why did you try to stop my arm?
	F: It's just

Fiore looks at someone, Elerra subtly following his gaze, to where Elerra's parents are gathered at the top table, like they're possibly arguing
	F: I just - it looks like somethings going on and I don't want to add - add anything. It was weird, but - but thank you.

Elerra double checks that the scratches have been healed
Though the tears in his clothes are still there, they are mostly hidden by the folds of his clothes
	E: This is going to sound very hypocritical of me, but please be careful of people whose intentions we don't know

The two share a look, a shared burden of the role he is falsely playing
	E: Be careful. Please. 
	E: I do not - I do not give two shits - Our parents will not give two shits if you defend yourself. Do not let yourself be pushed over because it wouldn't look right, or cause a scene. Or for what's right, or for what the House stands for, because we can always control narratives, we can change perceptions, but you don't let yourself get hurt, not -

Fiore nods, appreciative, still a little shaken.

Lorien approaches the Fade Dancers (and Elerra), looking unusually angry

Elerra approaches her Matron Mother

Sable has just been stood at the edge of the dancefloor
Kinda like he's just been dissociating the whole time
	No longer able to see Beau
	Nor his sister

Ezdi appears infront of him
	E: Are you ... okay?
	S: ... W - Er - air?

Ezdi steers Sable in the direction of a balcony, hand between his shoulder blades
Then stands a little bit back, uncertain as to whether to stay

Sable turns on his heel, suddenly alert and curious
	S: The thing on your back ... the mark?

Ezdi teeters on the threshold, then steps closer, resigned, kinda awkward
	E: it's a bit of a moodkiller, but
	S: I'm just problematically curious about things, I can't help -
	E: Right. Well.

Ezdi pulls out the drink again and takes a swig
Sable takes the offered drink as well

E: Right, so. My brother died a couple of years ago, and I was not in a good way after that. Quite lost.
E: A little outside of the city is the church of Shar -
S: I thought I recognised the symbol
E: It's quite distinct, isn't it
E: I don't remember a lot of my, in fact, most of my time, at the church
E: Avas - the Do'ghym - she likes to paint herself as my knight in shining armour. She got my house to save me.
E: But I don't remember it. I remember what I have been told and I was told that I needed to be saved from this.
E: I guess it's good that I don't remember it.

Ezdi laughs awkwardly, then settles into silence.

S: I thought that was going to be a much better story
E: From what I read up on Shar, that's the best story it could be
E: But it's fine, I don't remember it

Sable can pick up on a distinct thread of confusion with the retelling - it's just what they've been told - but there's no falsehood

Shrooms is a slur

Sable asks Ezdi about not letting the mushrooms listen
	E: I usually just let them. Are you considering getting spored?
	S: Probably not ... I like my privacy
	E: Makes sense. I don't really have a concept of it so ...
	S: I mean same. It just confuses me, as someone who follows people around for a living, it's confusing that you'd let something in your head like that all the time
	E: They're just sort of an extension of me at this point. I mean we are like ... a we.
	S: So if you spiked the punch bowl, the myconids would know?
	E: Yes, I'm sure they'd find it funny
	S: Sorry, I just ... I don't get the chance to ask about this kind of thing very often
	E: I'd like to get to know something about you, now?
	S: ... Okay, ask. Go for it -
	E: Oh, I offered the dead brother thing so
	S: Oh that's hard to beat. I also ... have dead siblings, if that's any measure of anything?
	E: I love gossip, I collect secrets
	S: And share with your myconids?
	E: I can keep it between us
	S: I fully trust - I fully trust whatever decision you want to make with your sharing
	E: My pockets are light and gossip is currency. Give me something!
	S: ... 

Ezdi leans in, no concept of personal space
Sable turns his back on the ballroom, then takes off his mask
Ezdi slips his mask off, slips Sable's mask on, then looks back at the ballroom
Rips off the mask, and goes to throw it away
Ezdi blinks, and the mask is back on Sable
Sable is still holding onto Ezdi's wrist, who is looking scared

Ezdi takes a step back, not breaking the hold, but staring at Sable
	E: Um. 
	E: Sable. Buddy. What the fuck?
	S: You asked for a - look! I'm just doing what you asked for here! You wanted a secret, so - to my knowledge, no-one else has seen that, ever.
	E: What is that?
	S: That's what I see, without help.
	E: I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but what's wrong with you?
	S: So ... I don't know how to dump this properly. Do you still have that flask?

Ezdi very slowly pulls out the flask.
Sable takes a quick swig, and holds onto it
	S: Think abstract for me. Ignore conventional rules. What's going on now is one very odd interpretation.
	S: What I see is sometimes a little bit different - sometimes behind, slightly ahead, or sometimes a lot behind or a lot ahead.
	S: And it gets a lot more difficult to focus.
	S: It comes from very dangerous magic that I may have toyed around with when I was younger.
	S: But as you can see, under control.
	S: That makes sense, right?
	E: ... I kinda wish I hadn't asked.
	E: You're impacting my life in a negative way, but. Thank you?
	E: I asked for gossip, I received gossip. I appreciate that, I appreciate you.
	S: I don't get to talk to people a lot - I'm
	E: ... I like what you're doing.
	S: No you don't?

Ezdi takes a step back, creating a bit of space.

S: I'm really sorry?
E: Yeah, no, I definitely feel like that's on par with the dead brother thing.
S: Yeah, I also have a dead family, and I get poisoned every day
E: That makes sense, you do look -
S: No, continue that!
E: I don't, you don't wanna -
S: I want to hold it against you properly
E: That scares me, you scare me a little
S: Cool.
E: Thanks for sharing though, I really do -
E: Can't wait to do nothing with that cause I'm too scared

Sable hands back the flask
...
E: I think someone's calling me, so -
E: I can't wait for us to ... speak again.

Ezdi leaves.

Sable catches sight of Beau in one of the shadows of the arches of the balcony.
Beau laughs, nearly doubled over
	B: I think that went great
	S: I'm really happy you found some entertainment from that.
	B: I think it's only fair - you sneak up on me and I sneak up on you
	S: How can I help you?
	B: You've already helped enough

Beau goes to re-enter the ballroom
Sable grabs his arm

S: It's bothering me. Why are you here? Everyone here is very very important, and in comparison, not to diminish, but you're not very important.
B: Listen, Sable.

Beau puts his hand on Sable's, where Sable had grabbed him
Then looks at Sable like one would look at a sad dog

B: We don't know each other that well, so I'm not going to tell you.
B: But, good luck trying to find out, I guess

Beau goes to break the hold
Successfully does so (23 vs 3 lmao)
And disappears into the crowd of people

---

The dancefloor empties as food is brought out, all manner of rich delicacies
As people take plates and take tidbits, sitting down

LM sits in direct eyeline of the Do'ghym Matron
Ezdi is also absent from the room

Odessa walks LM to her seat
Detect Poison and Disease
	The champagne glasses have a faint read - a little something
	All the food seems okay - some of the mushrooms have a tiny read

Odessa sits in Ezdi's seat
Sable is smoking on the balcony
Elerra watches the dance from the family table

---

As the lights dim for the second performance, Elerra can see an incredible strain on the Ilfar Matron's face
Lorian gets more pissed as the performance continues
The performance ends a little bit abruptly, but no major injury
And the Matron looks just a little bit worse
Lorien leaves the room, followed by Elerra's other mother

Elerra slips a message to her sister
E: Can you use your children to get mum out the room? Tell her that I have it covered.
Lise turns to look at Elerra, looking concerned, then agrees

The Matron and sister both exit the room.

---

Right before the lights are raised, Ezdi slips back in, looking very smug

Elerra rejoins the gang at the table
Ezdi sits next to Avas, who sighs, and looks away pointedly
Odessa sends a lil mental wave of curiousity
Ezdi _immediately_ jumps on the opportunity to explain, shaking the flask
	Ez: I did it guys. It's now empty - every barrel, every glass, it's done
	El: The entire cellar?
	Ezdi nods
	El: You realise you are going to pay me some money for that.
	Ez: Any price, to see this room _light_ up

Odessa can see the alcohol in the drinks that are now brought out - now lethal but definitely doing something
Odessa makes eye contact with the Matron to warn her off
Then turns back to Ezdi and takes a sip
Odessa blinks, then blinks again, then again, the room is breathing around her
She huffs a laugh, sinking back, allowing a bit of a feedback loop from the mushroom mind.

Elerra places a reassuring hand on Odessa's thigh
Odessa rests a hand ontop of hers, making eye contact with Ezdi
O: Mhmm

The vibe in the room gets a little slower, a little drunk
Odessa finishes her drink
There are shadows appearing where they shouldn't be - the movement of people where they aren't
	Similar to the Widdershin's Inn's paintings

---

As people rejoin the dance floor, Ezdi peels himself off the table, staggers upright, then heads to a balcony
Odessa follows him with her eyes, then catches Sable, and just watches for a moment.
Sable is looking out at the back of the cave, out at the waterfalls.
Then he hears the swish of a blade, and sees Beau sticking a blade into Ezdi's stomach

She can pick up that he's sort of sulking, and goes to stand up.
Then stops, staggering as she stands, feeling the feedback loop from Ezdi, feeling like she just got gutted.
