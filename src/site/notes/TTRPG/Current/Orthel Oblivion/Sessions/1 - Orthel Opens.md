[[TTRPG/Current/Orthel Oblivion/Orthel Oblivion\|Orthel Oblivion]] > [[TTRPG/Current/Orthel Oblivion/Sessions/2 - Locks and Collars\|2 - Locks and Collars]]


We start in the north of [[Orthel\|Orthel]], as a spider-drawn garish-white carriage pulls up to the main building of [[House Ilfar\|House Ilfar]]. The carriage is bright and out of place, too ornate, with too many curtains, too much gold, etc.

In one side of the carriage is [[Gwynn of House Arcice\|Gwynn of House Arcice]] - a fuckboi, smirking and sprawling. He looks bored and eager to be a dick.
On the other side is a buff tiefling with green skin and heavy obnoxious gold armour, heavy gold armour, two long braids, series of large old scars hidden down his neck. He is tiredly and pointedly looking out the window. (Named Wick)
Not wearing a collar, but wearing a thick anklet.

Next to him is [[Sable\|Sable]], dressed fancy in a lot of black with hints of teal (to match his eyes). 

His collar is silver with a thread of green. At the front is the sigil of [[House Arcice\|House Arcice]]. 

Sable can't ever remember being 100% healthy, but this nausea feels familiar; he has been poisoned many times by this house and by Gwynn.

Gwynn: Are you feeling okay? You're looking a little blue.
Sable: Tip top, and I don't want to overstep, but you're going to hurt your wrist, leaning on it like that.
Gwynn: I care for you so much, I do hope I didn't overdo it this time. It would be such a shame to lose you, like you lost your parents.
Sable: Don't worry, I'm stubborn.
Gwynn: You sure are. Are you excited? To be doing this instead of ... whatever you normally do?
Sable: It's nice, for some-one else to take over the privilege of your care.

Gwynn stops caring about the conversation, and he curls his wrist.
A leash materialises between his hand and Sable's collar, and he yanks it forward.

Gwynn: I'm not in the mood, today, for whatever this is. I don't want it, I don't really have time for it. Are you done?
Sable: I'm done. I didn't mean it, I'm sorry. It might just be a side effect of ... not dying, from the poisoning.
Gwynn: Stop speaking.

Gwynn taps him on the cheek, then pushes him back.
Sable adjusts his glasses and looks out the window.

The carriage slows to a stop outside of [[House Ilfar\|House Ilfar]]. Very old, organic, shaped by the water.

There are three drow standing there.
Lorie and Zyah ?
Cool lady with mohawk. Black pantsuit number.
Lorian - Performer, built like a dancer with slender build with flowy clothes.
And [[Elerra\|Elerra]] - she's standing between her parents, fiddling with a bracelet, sort of looking like she doesn't want to be here but half-hiding it.

Her mother takes Elerra's hands.
Zyah: Do you want the Matronly speech or the Motherly speech?
Elerra: Let's go for the Motherly today.
Zyah: This is going to go terribly, it always will. But the Sovereign likes House Arcice for some reason, so please play nice.
Elerra: I always do.
Zyah: Okay, matronly.

Zyah reaches from somewhere behind her to pull out three wax seal envelopes. Addressed to La'val, Desor, and Shavlyl. They are invites to a ball held at Ilfar at the end of the week.

Zyah: You are representing the House today, meeting the Matrons. They ruled over [[Wyn'vri\|Wyn'vri]], and we will give them the respect they are due.

She squeezes Elerra's hands, looking proud. 
Elerra's other mother is watching, from deep in the shadows, also proud.

---

The three emerge from the carriage.
Wick grunts and steps away
Gwynn slinks out, and fails to notice Elerra gags a little.
Lorian goes to shake Gwynn's hand

Gwynn: Lorian! I caught one of shows last week.
...
Gwynn: Where is the Matron? I haven't seen her since the ball last week!
Elerra: Well, she's far too busy to be escorting me to these kinds of meetings.

Gwynn's smile dims a little.

Gwynn: Right, she studies the Faezress. She has little time to get out, unlike you. What is it that you do again?
Elerra giggles just a little.
Zyah: We thank you for taking your time to accompany Elerra today, away from your studies, training for the apocathery.
Elerra rolls her eyes at Sable, who just . nods.

Gwynn goes to take Elerra's hand.
She allows it.
Gwynn kisses the back of her hand, then gestures towards the carriage.

As Elerra bids her parents goodbye, Gwynn is playing with Sable's leash, glinting in and out of existence, tugging slightly.
Elerra bumps into him to get him to drop the leash, doing so successfully.

They all get into the carriage, and drive off.

---

Elerra attempts to make banal conversation.
Gwynn: Right yes. Anyway, have you heard anything about the Matrons?
Elerra: Which ones? There are so many Matrons.
Gwynn: The ones from Wyn'vri.
Elerra: No, I've been too busy with my singing practice for the ball.
Gwynn: You're so right.

Elerra whispers to Sable: Has he gotten more conceited since I last spoke to him?
Sable: Perhaps he is too stupid to understand.

Gwynn: I heard that [[House La'val\|House La'val]] used to rule over Wyn'vri, and all are stout Lolth worshippers, enough to catch the attention of the Sovereign. After their power, and their Blessings.
Elerra: Their Blessings? Did I forget something?
Gwynn: I've heard that they have some kind of gift? Some kind of Blessing from Lolth. One is a very powerful Seer, one is a very powerful Demon-Conjurer, and one that no-one really cares about.

Sable: He's not wise enough for conventional threats.
Elerra: Twenty years of this. He's got to figure it out soon.
Sable: Don't worry, he's had plenty of threats his way.

---

The carriage heads up to the top of [[Shelith Market\|Shelith Market]].

Crowded, sharp stone buildings, bridges made of bridges between them. 
Arrive at [[Shelith Hall\|Shelith Hall]], the center of the mushroom roots that head throughout the market, pulsing with life.

They all step out.

They notice some heavily clothed wood elves (like its far colder than it is). Also look very young, and Elerra can feel that these lot are _angry_.

Inside, the myconid seem to be feeding the drow, rations of moss fish etc.
Gwynn leads the lot through the main hall into a stone corridor.

Behind the door at the end of the corridor is a large throne room.
	One large throne (way too fucking big, such as a 20ft tall sovereign), with two smaller thrones on each side.
	These are occupied by old and shriveled bigger-than-average myconids - the Elders of some of the Circles.
	At the foot are three figures - 
		One is small, round, brown, and wrinkly, with a large cap.
		One is taller green one, wearing a smaller cap, with smaller caps on their shoulders and down their legs.
		Between them is a drow, young, with choppy white hair, pale eyes hazed over with green. Smiling, some of his teeth have been capped with emeralds. A sigil clasps his cloak. Ezdi of House Lyzar.
	Infront of them are four people -
		Tall thin woman with a floaty air, pale red eyes, paler red scelera, long white hair tied in a thin gold webbed net, and a huge gold quarterstaff with the top split into a Y, webs purposefully spun between them. She's looking quite sick, is [[TTRPG/Current/Orthel Oblivion/Wiki/Person/Ilaris La'val\|Ilaris La'val]]
		Messy black hair, red eyes, red lips, sharp teeth, neck is ropy with fresh red scarring, wearing black furs, and a mass of legs crawls out of them, before standing at her feet chittering. Ilia Desor
		Shavlyl, simple clothes, stacked silver necklaces. Skin and eyes and hair are all very silver. She's wearing a huge fuck-off sword, curved at the tip, engraved in a language no-one can read, on her hip.
		Stood a little behind Illaris is [[Odessa\|Odessa]].

Odessa makes a Wis Save.
	She is aware that Ilia has a strange presence (mechanically is Frightened), just a constant tension.

Ezdi addresses the group, translating the humming from the brown myconid.
Ezdi: The repor-spores are not mandatory, but they mean you no harm. The spores are simply welcoming you into the city, and into your mycelium. 
Ilia steps an inch forward. Ezdi steps a foot back.
Ilia: We appreciate the welcome, of course, but perhaps you should give us time to think about it.
Ezdi: Sounds good!

Ezdi looks at Odessa, almost desperate to look away from Ilia.
Ezdi: I've been horribly rude to you, what's your name?
Odessa: Odessa, and it's not rude.
Odessa looks, almost helplessly, at Illaris.
Odessa: The Matrons are the ones who arrived later than the refugees, but I believe we'll be sticking around, we don't really have anywhere else to go?

The doors open, and Ezdi sighs in relief.
Ezdi: This is Elerra, of House Ilfar, they are a big deal in the city.
Gwynn: I'm Gwynn of House Arcice, it's a pleasure to meet you.

The Matrons all ignore him, and look at Elerra.
Both save against the fear.

Ilia extends a hand to Elerra.
Ilia: House Ilfar? I understand your House rules the city, after the Sovereign, of course.
Elerra: We are tasked by the Sovereign to look after the Waters of the city, and we take great pride in our role.
Ilia: Ah yes, he must be so glad to have you. So glad, that he didn't come see us today, but he must be busy.

Ezdi: We'll give you the room.
Everyone leaves the room - except our parties.

Elerra reaches into her pockets, and addresses each Matron in turn.
Elerra: House Ilfar holds a ball each month, and we would like to invite you to the next one. We would love to see you there, if you are able to attend.
Illaris doesn't seem present in the conversation, so Odessa steps forward and takes the invitation on her behalf.

Ilia: Who are these people? Is this your consort?
Elerra quickly goes: No! No, this is Gwynn of House Arcice.
Ilia: Yes, I wouldn't recommend that one. He's far too ... skinny? Weak? Same with the other one, actually.
Ilia: We appreciate the invitation. Also, we don't really understand the myconid, but it's a pleasure to meet you.
Ilia: Do you respect this Sovereign? What is he, exactly?
Elerra: He is a kind and astute individual, in my interactions with him. My mother has far more dealings with him, as I'm merely the youngest daughter. She's currently busy with the Waters, but will be in attendance at the Ball. There, the Fey Dancers are absolutely a beauty to behold.
Ilia: Oh, a Dancer?
Elerra: Not me, I sometimes sing, but otherwise I must socialise.

---

There's a hint of a commotion from down the corridor, with heavy armoured footfall.

In the back of Odessa's head, she hears Illaris' voice, saying 'Just let it happen.'
Elerra slips away to a pillar.
Sable pulls on a pare of very ornate gloves.
Gwynn looks at Wick, demands: What's happening?
Gwynn unconsciously backs up.
Hear a very short combat outside, before the doors swing open, revealing the three disgruntled wood elves.

We immediately begin combat
Elerra shoots them, casting and blocking a Faezress reaction.

The two guys at the back put their hands on the front guy's shoulder, who pulls out snow from his pocket.
He blows out the powder into the room, carrying on a magic icy wind.
5 more guys materialise from the powder.

Sable creates a Gravity bubble that starts to crush the 3 guys at the front.

Shavlyl Matron creates an Echo, and just slashes a million times on two of them, eviscerating them.
Desor Matron steps forward, locks eyes with one of the elves, who takes out his knife and cuts his own throat, and collapses to the ground.
Iliaris walks towards the throne, and Odessa asks: Mother, what is *it*?
Illaris grips Odessa's shoulder, like 'get over it', and heads up, Odessa following at her side.

Wick slams his hammer on the prone guy's head, turning it into paste.

Elerra casts a Quickened Shatter on Illaris and Odessa
Illaris puts her hand on Odessa's shoulder, casting foresight.
Odessa also casts Hellish Rebuke on Elerra

Elerra to Illaris: That isn't yours to touch, step away. You are a guest in this city, act it.
Illaris keeps her hand on Oddesa's arm, but turns away from the throne.
Illaris: What was that?
Elerra: You're touching what's not yours. Step the fuck away, Matron.
Illaris does retract her hand from the throne, and stands more solidly behind Odessa.

Elerra then shoots one of the elves

The elves all shoot the La'val Matron
The arrows seem to have frozen the skin, with a settling frost.

Sable's veins glow, before the veins reach the gloves, and two magic missiles kill the remaining two guys at the front.

Shalvyl kills one, nearly kills another. Desor finishes him off.
Odessa flicks her fingers and nearly kills the final one.
Wick goes to them, goes to bonk, stops. The last guy is slumped forwards, frothing at the mouth.

---

Elerra sees the Echo dissolve, and sees Shalvyl taste a meat chunk of a body, then put a hand in her pocket.
