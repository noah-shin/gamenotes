Sable has a convo with Esdi, lmao very awkward
Esdi's poisoned most of the drinks with alcohol
Odessa and Esdi eye fuck and telepathically fuck for a bit
Esdi gets some air, gets stabbed by Beau

</div></div>



Initiative roll

Elerra can tell what's happened, can feel the cut actively happening, dragged up and into a circle around Esdi's stomach
The nearby guards look like they're straining, fighting to move
Elerra goes to Vortex Warps Beau into the centre of the room
Sable attempts Counter Spell
Elerra locks eyes with him, and forces negative Faerzress
Sable succeeds (after shennanigans)
Elerra then manipulates the Waters to jettison Esdi and Sable into the center of the room

Sable casts Darkness on Elerra's dress

Odessa heals herself of the poison
Summons her morningstar, and yells 'Halt - explain yourself'
Beau raises his hands in surrender and says: Fear is binding, only without it can we be free.

*hidden stuff was here*

Beau does nothing for his turn
Elerra casts Heat Metal on Sable
Odessa focuses on Elerra 'Stop.'
Elerra (through shrooms and a message) 'There have been many things I can forgive, but you causing violence within my home, when I invited you into _my_ home, my sanctuary, my place of safety, to my family. You would allow him to escape, [something else beautiful and threatening]. You would think me na√Øve? I will '
Elerra (only to Odessa) 'He has already lost my trust. If you take his side, you will lose it too, and you can't get it back.'
Odessa: I see the drow really are all the same. You deliver justice like this?
Elerra: This isn't vengeance. This is me being fed up of a world. 
Odessa: ...

Sable walks into the Darkness
Takes off his mask
Drops darkness
Walks up to Elerra
Presses the mask to her chest
Sable: I didn't intend for that to happen, I didn't know he was going to be here, I didn't think he'd hurt anyone, I didn't want to see anyone get hurt, and I thought you were gonna hurt him. I don't wanna see you get hurt, or Esdi get hurt, or him get hurt. Please don't let the hurt go on. 

Elerra was crying throughout the entire thing.
Elerra: If you didn't want people to get hurt, then you should've trusted me, to know that I'm not the kind of person to hurt somebody. Your lack of faith or trust in me is what puts this hurt on this field. Cause now you're exactly like every person who came before you.

Odessa walks forward, splaying a hand across Esdi's neck, casting Cure Wounds on the circular brands where they reach.
::spoilers Odessa can feel this Presence, a magical resonance where the sharran magic meet the runes::
The half carved matching circle on his stomach closes slightly, and his eyes flutter open.

Odessa steps forward, grabbing Beau by the back, digging the morningstar into his chin.
She whispers ::spoilers a different thirteenth truth into his ear::

Beau lowers his head, breaking his skin against the weapon.
He says: Pain is a lesson is a lesson. Only in suffering do we learn.
Odessa dismisses the weapon, grabs him by the throat, and hands him over to one of the guards.

The guards shackle him with simple cuffs but inscribed on the inside.
The moment they close, the illusion drops, and there is a matching brand that spans his back.
They escort him from the room.

Odessa orders the ballroom cleared.
Rocky, the Ilfar weaponmaster, hustles everyone out.
Doghym and DSL Matrons linger. Arcice are at the door, waiting to talk to Sable.

Avis had stepped forwards, Silvius in tow, to help Esdi up.
She looks unsurprised.
Odessa is also supporting Esdi, and Matron Lyszar also comes over, gesturing for a guard to come help.

Elerra doesn't take her eyes off Sable, but says: 'Silvius, can you please - escort Esdi to some support please.'
Silvius looks at Sable pointedly. Elerra minutely shakes her head.

Odessa brushes some blood off Esdi's cheek, casting Healing Hands on him.
Silvius, and Matron Lyszar escort him to safety elsewhere in the house.

Avis is lingering, not looking at Odessa, asks: You work for the La'val Matron, right?
O: Yes.
A: As a hired hand?
O: As a daughter in name.
Avis looks away from Esdi's retreating back to Odessa, mildly shocked.
A: They won't kill him, you know. They'll let him walk. I think something needs to be done.
O, not looking at Avis: Something will be done.
She doesn't look satisfied.
O: I'll be in touch.

Elerra raises her voice: If you do not belong to House Ilfar, this is your request to leave, before you are escorted out.

Everyone else begins to leave. 
LM and Doghym Matron move together as they all leave, stepping inside the wall of Speakers.
The Arcice Matron gives Sable a look as they pass to leave the ballroom.
Odessa also gives the AM a look as they pass her.

Eventually, the room is mostly cleared (the band probably still packing up at the far end).

Sable pulls the mask back a bit, pops the lens out, puts them back in his glasses, popping them back on.
Elerra takes a step back when he removes the mask.
Odessa parks up on a table edge.
Sable starts smoking.
S: I'm sorry?
S: I mean this with the most genuine sincerity - I was just scared and acted to protect somebody. I didn't do it in a way that would continue harm to you, and I _had_ a plan, but then everything kinda fell apart. I - I had an idea to make sure that nobody would get hurt. You - y - you kinda broke it. I understand I should've not done anything, but I can't not act - when I - when I see somebody who's important get attacked.

Elerra's face goes flat, and her mushroom link has shut down.

E: You didn't want anybody to get hurt, so you protected the person hurting someone? Esdi doesn't count?
S: No, I was - I was going to stop it. You got there faster, you were quicker, and you tried something and I didn't know what it was. I know you're a very capable person and I was worried about - what you could do.
E: How long have you known me?
S: In fairness, I don't think I've begun to actually understand who you are over the last few days.
E: That wasn't the question I asked.
S: A very long time.
E: Twenty years that you've known me. That we've had magic lessons that weren't really lessons, but us being friends. What exactly was your belief of my character, from all this time, that somebody you've known somebody for two days would be worth more than me. I stood up for you, I put my House and my life on the line for you, and you couldn't give me the benefit of the doubt, just once? I'd started to believe that I was important to you, and it appears that I was wrong. That transparency you demanded was bullshit. Don't linger on your way out.

Elerra begins to walk out.

O: The benefit of the doubt? What does that look like from you?

Elerra has left the ballroom to go do stuff.
