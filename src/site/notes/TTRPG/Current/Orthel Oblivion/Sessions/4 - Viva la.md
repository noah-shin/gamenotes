The magic is evidently not happy at being contained in a flesh prison, feeling like its splitting his skin.
The rest pushes out of Sable, erupting in lines from his skin, leaving only the faintest trace.
Even in this silence there's a deafening boom, the air tastes like metal and ozone, and Sable passes out
It crashes into Elerra, nearly killing her
The silence dissipates from the floor.

Odessa rushes over to Sable
His sleeves from the elbow down are shredded, and it looks like lines have been carved out through his skin.
Odessa dumps one hit point into Sable and into Elerra.

Sable: In full transparency, I don't know what happened with most of that

Odessa gives Sable her fine clothes to wear / and as bandages

Sable: A rune is a storage of raw magic. What if someone took that magic, and moved it just a little?
Sable: Also can we not tell anyone about the moving?
Elerra: And can you not reveal anything about my martial prowess?
Sable: We are liars, and we do not showcase our abilities so that people underestimate us.
Sable: **The existence of power invites challenge.**
Odessa doesn't get why, but agrees

Odessa offers to punch Gwynn - both of them refuse to allow her

---

The group look out the window - first floor of a residential district
They all jump out, Odessa catching them

Start heading to the House Arcice apocathery
Shelith market is now a little more lively

The apocathery is a garish white, gothic wood, blue and green stained glass windows, planters from the surface, sharp gold lettering reading the name.
Brightly light with dancing gold lights, blue and gold embellishments and glass bottles.
Also fairly busy with customers.

Arrive in, guy behind the counter (cool animal tattoos) goes 'this way, she's not doing well' and leads us upstairs
Narrow corridor, second door to the left is a large storage area that's mostly been cleared out for a bed
Gwynn, Wick, Arcice Matron (Gauzelia) (looking very annoyed at this whole situation), Desor Matron, Shavyl Matron, Arcice eldest (Aryl?) are all in the room
Laval Matron in the bed, still unconscious, the wounds still frozen over

Elerra introduces Odessa to the Arcice Matron
Odessa bows slightly, gives a cursory thanks

Gwynn pointedly looks at Sable, clearly disgusted at his state

Odessa bows (deeper) to the other Matrons
Explains the whole thing - not quite taking the credit but not mentioning the others, and being very vague about how the rune got dispelled
Hands over the stone to the Shavlyl Matron
	'If you dispelled it, she should be fine, so obviously something went wrong.'

Sable: I was the one to dispel it, and I ended up like this. I did not get a formal education, and did the best as I could, and it may have not been enough.
Gwynn yanks Sable down by the leash: I'm so sorry Sable was a disappointment. 
Elerra reacts to that, looking appalled and over at the Arcice Matron.

Shavlyl Matron also looks over at Sable, and stalks towards him, pulling out her huge sword
Wick steps infront of Gwynn.
Elerra grabs Gwynn's hand and twists his thumb back to make him let go.

Shavlyl Matron hisses out: Fix it. What did you do wrong?
Sable: I don't know.
Everyone can tell that he's lying

Elerra: I believe that our emotions are getting a little heighted. We should allow ourself to take a moment, for some of us are acting _unbecoming_ and it would be disrespectful to act in such a manner.

Gwynn lets go of the leash and the pressure around Sable's neck goes slack

Elerra: This, as a representative of House Ilfar and the Waters, this is not the magic that we are used to. As such, these are unknowns that we are going to have to traverse together.

Shavlyl Matron slowly resheathes her sword, still glaring at Sable.

Sable steps forward and casts Dispel Rune on himself - trying to make it look like he's casting it on the La'val Matron.
_Barely_ beats the DC to remove it
Fails to convince the Shavlyl Matron that its on the Laval Matron
Sable can feel the magic hovering under his skin zip away - it hurts a little but doesn't cause any extra damage, and exhaustion begins to set in.
Everyone by the bed watches as the frosted areas recede to nothing, and her eyelids flutter slightly.

Elerra forces Gwynn to his knees, lifts his chin up
Elerra: This is why I keep rejecting you, acting that way is disgusting. This behaviour cannot be allowed within this city, because how can I be with someone who does not respect another living being?

She inclines her head to the Arcice Matron, apologetic.
Elerra: House Ilfar consider House Arcice to be close allies and friends. I hope what I'm about to say doesn't impact that. You son is not allowed at the ball. If he were to turn up, he would be escorted out. You have to understand that he has to be held accountable for his behaviour. It is just him who has to bear the consequences, not the House, so it is just him who is refused invite.

Gwynn remains on his knees, crumpled.
Arcice Mother: He will be punished accordingly, and I understand his invitation has been revoked. I apologise, to everyone, that you had to see that.
Elerra: I hope you would ensure that no-one else in your care would be treated like that again.
Elerra looks pointedly at Sable. The Arcice Mother nods, reluctant, and does not regard Sable.
Elerra gets a weird shiver at the way she nods, though she isn't lying.
Odessa knows that how the Arcice Mother treats the son, and as an extension Sable, is very familiar; and is lying.

Wick escorts Gwynn out the room, Sable leans against the wall, Arcice women says her goodbyes.
Odessa catches the Matron before she leaves: If a tool is found faulty, then there may other uses for it, especially whilst they linger in ... certain House's memories.
Matron: We know how valuable he is to the House. This House definitely has a history, and definitely remembers what he did.

Desor Matron lifts the La'val Matron, and escorts them back to the Widdershin's Inn.
Now just the three of us in the room, the leash flickering out of existence. 

Elerra: When I do report back to the Sovereign, I'm sure he will be just as disapproving of it.
Sable is quietly hitting the floor: Why did you have the need to intervene?
Elerra explains that it would never get spread.
Sable: I had everything perfectly painted out. Simplicity is beautiful if you look at it from the right perspective. I am working on a very difficult angle and trying very stupid things, and you are making it harder.

Sable: I am a trophy? A prize, a fond memory to relive, a display of power.
Elerra reveals that she genuinely holds those morals that people should be treated with respect.
Sable believes that we're all like minded in wanting to change the city.

Odessa gives Sable her remaining clothes.

Sable: Every once in a while, its fun to walk in a dead man's shoes.

Odessa walks Elerra home. At the door, goes "genuinely heartwarming, my lady", and kisses the back of her hand.




### Summary

Leave the house
Sable almost dies cause he's still got the runic magic in him
Start the revolution
