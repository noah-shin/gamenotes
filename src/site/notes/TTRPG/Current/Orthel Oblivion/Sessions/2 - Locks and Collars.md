> Summary

Sable starts looting the bodies
	Intelligence check
		Sable maybe recognises him?
		They all works at / frequents a toy store in Shelith Market - [[Tiny's Toy Emporium\|Tiny's Toy Emporium]]
			normally run by young teens
			Tiny looks like fantasy Santa
	Investigation check 
		They're all wearing thick winter clothes
		They have bows and arrows - with stone arrowheads 
		With markings on the arrowheads - a line with a circle around it
	And 5GP

Elerra heads to Desor Matron
E : I've never seen anyone fight like that?
DM: I'm sure you haven't, its part of my Blessing.
E : Blessing?
DM begins to tell E the whole story of the Hallowing
	The razing of the city, navigating the Abyss, getting tested by Lolth, having to kill everyone in their Houses to sacrifice them to Lolth

Sable sneakily takes one of those arrowheads
Then heads to Gwynn
	Who is being babied by Wick

E : You must have seen so much! I was hiding that whole fight
G : Of course ... (embarrassed)

Elerra mentally messages the myconids
E (frightened): There was an attack in the throne room! Send help?
E : Is the King somewhere else?
There's a general sense of panic from every myconid in response
King : We're sending people there now.

Odessa had turned straight to Illaris
Arcana check - can tell the arrows are magic
Illaris collapses, 3 arrows in her, unconscious
Odessa yanks out the arrow, and dumps 5 points of lay on hands
	Can also see the symbol on the arrowhead
	The wound bleeds for a moment then immediately freezes over
	The lay on hands does nothing to stop the spreading

Sable steps forwards, trying to identify Illaris' magical focus
	Probably the magic staff

Shavlyl Matron rushes forward to Illaris as well
	Picks up the arrow I yanked out
	She knows something
She steps forward, lowering her voice
SM : This has been imbued with runic magic. That's unusual.
O : How long does she have?
SM : If we don't find the caster, we have a day.

Odessa stands, to take Illaris home.
Ezdi and some guards from his House enter, along with the two mushrooms.
The guards spread out.
The mushroom releases these black spores that settle over the dead bodies.

Ezdi recognises the bodies : Oh, those are the Lightflower boys, we have to send someone immediately to the toymakers to tell them

Ezdi tries to get in the way of Odessa
	Odessa explains the situation, then asks for medicinal facilities
	(The Matrons are currently staying at the [[Widdershins Inn\|Widdershins Inn]])
	Gwynn steps forwards, offering the Arcice apocathery

Odessa to the Matrons : May I request that you take care of her, while I identify and _deal_ with the caster?
DM takes Illaris, and agrees.

Gwynn : May I offer my assistant to help you with your search?
Sable : I would be happy to help, in any way I can.
Ezdi : I think Elerra should join you, in order to mitigate the effect of any Faezress
Gwynn looks uncomfy at the idea of Elerra being 'with the poor people'.
Elerra : I would be glad to! I'm sorry Gwynn, that our afternoon got short, but there's always next time!

Odessa grabs the SM right before leaving (alone in the Throne Room)
O : Is there something else that you wanted to add?
SM : There's a non-zero chance that, in seeking the caster, the rune will explode, and kill you. I would, I don't know how to dispel runes from the source, so, try not to destroy it. Maybe keep it?

E & S don't know anything specific about runic magic
	There's not a lot written down about it, and not within the city
	There is common/arcane magic, which pulls a very small part of the Weave out to use
	Runic magic interacts directly with the raw magic behind the Weave
E remembers one of the Houses in the city talking about using runic magic
	[[House Do'ghym\|House Do'ghym]]
	Some mention of runic magic and the Faezress (which is related to the Waters)

---

Odessa steps back in.
Picks up all the arrows in the room - 60 in total

Some of the bodies are beginning to animate
	Turning into Spore Servants

Sable : At last, I can speak freely. Odessa, you confuse me. Where are we going?
Odessa: Do you know any hubs of runic magic?
E & S shake their head. O can tell there's a lil something they're hiding.

We head back out through the hall, and towards the toy emporium, Sable leading.
A lot of the stores are shuttered for the day.
We follow the store spiral up.
The Emporium is currently shut, potentially recently vacated for the day.
	On the left is a big tent made of furs and pelts.
	On the right is a big stall that smells of bread.
	In front of it is a bright pink stall.

Elerra tries the front door, its locked.
Elerra pulls out some thieves' tools.
Odessa turns her back and crosses her arms, blocking E from view.
O notices the dark pink stall, two ornate mirrors on either side, with cosmetics, makeup and perfumes.
	Behind it is a drow man, with light red eyes, plunging shirt.
O sighs, sets her weight, strides forward to him.
E picks the lock, easy with a nat 20.
	Can feel it pushing back against her, magically locked.

Odessa can see someone else in the tent
	Wearing a thick pink veil covering her face and neck, with a plunging dress.

Shopkeep : What's going on?
O : You know the proprieter?
Shopkeep : Such fancy words, yeah, I know Tiny.
O : He in there?
Shopkeep : No, I think I saw him leave about an hour ago, packed up an hour ago.
O : Know where he went?
Shopkeep : He's kind of weird, so no, not really. Why, what's going on? What's Tiny do this time?
O : This time?
Shopkeep : See, you're asking a lot of questions and not answering any of mine.
O : You've only asked one.
Shopkeep : What do you want with him?
O : That's kind of obvious, isn't it?
Shopkeep : Not really?
Odessa just growls.
Shopkeep genuinely can't think of a reason why Tiny would be wanted.
Odessa chucks him under the chin, smiling.
O (charming) : You won't be telling anyone about this.
Shopkeep : Of _course_ not.
O (intimidating) : You won't.

At the door of the Emporium
Elerra asks for a Detect Magic - to check for traps
Odessa casts it successfully
	Can sense dissipating abjuration magic from the lock.
	Elerra's bow is glowing with evocation
	Her house sigil is a necklace glowing with multiple kinds, mostly evocation
	Her daggers glowing with the same evocation magic signature as the bow
	Can't see anything from Sable
	Can't even see the arrowhead in Sable's pocket, or the collar

E opens the doors
Small shop, wooden shelves lined with handmade toys
	Some catch the light, having elements of ice in their design
	These are not registering as magic.
Workbench at the back, with double doors at the side, pulsing with abjuration and conjuration magic.

Lil convo
S : I guess controlling the water of someone is easier when they're full of ice.
Odessa can't come up with a response, cause she knows she should have one but.

O & S check the shop and toys
	Can see the same rune on the base of the toys with the ice elements
		Not triggering the Detect Magic
	Can see the shop was vacated quite quickly.
E checks the workbench
	Finds a letter within the last week or so between Tiny Lightflower and Rinna Fae'theryl
		Comments that the Matrons have been spotted within Orthel
		Asks Tiny to 'send your best soldiers in. Good luck.'

Elerra picks up a wood chisel.
E to O : Do your muscles need any more chiseling?

Sable looks out - the Shopkeep is still standing there, almost waiting expectantly
S : I'm not sure Odessa was as thorough as they should've been, too busy ... chucking them under the chin. Priorities, you know.
O : ...
E trips S up as he leaves.

S to Shopkeep : Hi.
Shopkeep : Hello handsome. How can I help you?
S : What's your name?
Shopkeep : Beau
S : How long have you been set up here?
B : Couple of months. Tiny's only been here for about a month. He's got a weird energy, all those kids around him, working for him?
S : I don't know if my companion, the smush your head between my thighs companion, asked which way Tiny went?
B : Back the way you came from. Have you been through that door yet?
S : What's through that door? Its between us and the veil person.
B stiffens up : That's my sister, so. Her name is Ason, not _veil person_.
B : Listen, if you like to, you can do something for me, and I can do several somethings for you.
Beau looks over at the stall with the pelts
	Manned by an older dwarven man, and two young dwarves, one a woman just growing out her beard.
B : If you get me a lock of her hair, I will tell you what I want.
S : That's . kinda in line with the creepy kids thing.
B : Child labour is the same as a lock of hair?

Sable points at the dwarf, and minor illusions the lock of hair.
Beau can see straight through it.

---

E casts Create or Destroy Water on the door
	But the door doesn't feel like wood, or even anything known
The door gives a little, cracking, but doesn't open.

E goes out to maybe help Sable.

---

Sable heads to the pelt shop
	A wooden sign shaped into a wolf's head reading **Silverbraids**
	Filled with crates and barrels of meat
	Some hunting supplies and clothing from the pelts

Sable approaches the female dwarf
S : Do you happen to know Beau?
Dwarf : Who the fuck are you?
S : A potential customer
Dwarf : You don't look the sort
S : No, I'm the errand boy sort
Dwarf : Yea I know Beau, why?
S : He's got a curious request I'm gonna ask you to entertain. He was interested in a lock of your hair.

Sable points back at Beau, who waves.

Dwarf looks even more angry, somehow.
She leans in a little and asks : And why does he want that?
S : To bargain, I believe? It's a very stupid and convoluted series of events. I can tell him no, but I think it'd be quite funny to go back with just a strand.
Dwarf : Let me spell this out. You want me to give you a strand of hair, to give to him. Well, as the errand boy, you can go back to Beau that if he comes near my head I'm going to have his.
S : I imagine there is no situation where you willingly give a strand -
Dwarf : Would you give a wizard a lock of your hair? 
S : Son of a bitch.
Dwarf : I didn't think so, so you can fuck off.

Elerra reaches them
E : Is this guy harassing you? I swear to god, the men in this town - can you leave this person alone?
S : Oh no ...
E : Are you just going to leave and get someone else's hair, pervert.
S : That's me, I ... love hair.
Dwarf to E : Are you going to buy something?
E : Honestly I'm just hiding. Have you ever met Gwynn?
Dwarf : I can't say I've had the pleasure ... Is this someone I should care about?
E : No, he's the asshole of the biggest proportion.
Dwarf : Are you here to hide or to buy something?
E : Can I hide?
Dwarf : No.
Dwarf : Where I'm from, we usually kill them, when they're that persistent.
E : Well, what are you selling?
Dwarf : Mostly meat.
E : What about that rope?
E grabs a loose strand of hair as it falls to the floor, covering it with 'oops I dropped my coins'.
Dwarf : That'll be 10GP
E : I have a silver.
Dwarf : You're good for it, though
E : I don't
Dwarf grips the axe tighter. The older dwarf clears his thought and gestures for the silver.

---

E returns to the Emporium
E to S : You owe me a silver
S : Take it out of my next payment
Sable hands over a bloody gold, E gives the change back

S takes the strand to Beau
S makes eye contact with him through one of the mirrors, and B turns
B : One second, I need to verify

He grabs a shard of pink-tinted glass from under the table, inspects the hair, then puts it somewhere in his shirt.
S : So, how can we get through that door, without taking any harm?
B leans in and whispers : I've heard Tiny speak a little phrase into the keyhole
	High Queen, hold this door
S : And as one practitioner to another, I can't think of a single spell that requires just a little bit of hair, so what might that be for?
B : I'll give it to you, because you're funny. It's not anything arcane, it was something passed down.  Tell you what, come back in a day, maybe buy something, and I'll show you.

---

O and E have a lil chat about the Laval Matron
Then E starts on about colour theory
S enters, and heads to the door, whispers the phrase
The door unlocks, not yet opening.

Sable opens it, into a large room, with three closed doors, one on each stone wall. The door is definitely a portal of some kind.
There are two shelves with supplies and some more toys.
The air here is definitely colder.
