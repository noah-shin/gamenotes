### Summary

We open to a Ball that is actually a Battle
Sable vs Elerra counterspell
Manage to stop Beau, he gets taken to prison
Also save Esdi, and he gets taken to the infirmary
Little chat between Avis and Odessa
Elerra kicks everyone out the ballroom, then she and Sable _chat_. 
Sable comes clean about wanting to kill (a) God.
Elerra goes to take care of shit, Sable and Odessa talk about him fucking a God, then make out.
Elerra returns, stunned that Sable was just doing it all for 'love'. 
More chat, Sable reads a book on House Arcice history, Elerra and Odessa make out.

</div></div>



Sable slowly puts his books down, then approaches.
S: Beau?
Odessa breaks from the kiss and blinks lazily at Sable. 
Elerra lets Sable's rambling continue, but Odessa leans down for a quick kiss before hopping off the balcony and straightens her look.
O: Yes, I want to figure out what his motivations were, if anything.
Quick chat about our fits - and whether we need to change them (we are a group that are quite noticeable right now, and perhaps don't want our locations to be reported - Elerra especially in our company)
We stealth to the dressing room, Odessa jingle jangles but manage to get there safely, despite the increased guard presence, and in unusual areas.

---

We grab our other shit, Odessa gets changed.
Sable helps her out, no hesitation.
He can see her assortment of shitty tattoos and variety of scars, including a thin line on her neck with veins of white, and a stab wound on her front and back with veins of purple.
Sable also undoes Elerra's corset with a quick prestidigitation, then she gets dressed into a short black dress, enough to reveal thigh holsters holding a pair of ice-blue daggers.

Sable holds out a hand for Odessa, then casts Invisibility on them both.
We head to the tallest tower / dungeon, to the bridge over the river leading to it.
> There are various towers that branch over the main house, set in the middle of the different rivers.
> The bridge has open arches that lead to the river, and is patrolled by various guards.

We stealth to the bridge, Elerra just walking normally, like she belongs here.
Elerra can see a shadow where there shouldn't be, for half a second, infront of us close to the bridge.
Elerra steps up to cross the bridge, one of the guards speaks up. (Odessa's hand twitches just a little)
Guard: I'm sorry, have you been ... permitted to see the prisoner? I haven't heard anything from the Matron Deepwater.
Elerra: She requested that I ask some further questions that she had. Sorry that you weren't informed, but these decisions are made quickly and made by individuals who aren't going to run here to inform you.
The guard bows his head in apology, gestures to the other guards to let her through, then bows a little deeper than they normally do.

---

We have arrived in the tower - the ground floor are training rooms (for the family and Elerra), then a stone staircase that spirals up to the three floors of dungeons at the top of the tower.
> It's a very dark, dank space, echoing and with the sound of dripping water.
> There are three layers of semi-circle of cells, with the backs of the rooms removed to be a drop straight into the Waters below.
> At the base is an office, five guards, one with a set of keys (Lance - unofficial House Weaponmaster), one inventorying Beau's possessions.

E heads straight to Lance, leans forward to whisper: Mother sai- Matron Deepwater said that I could have a word with the prisoner in private, just a follow up about what was said to me, before others got involved. Just in regard to some confidential information, that you can't know.
Lance, uptight duty-bound kinda guy, looks uncomfy about leaving Elerra with the prisoner, but Beau looks pathetic enough, so: We will be downstairs, please call us if you need us.
All the guards walk out, the crate of Beau's stuff is locked, Lance hands Elerra the keys, who secures them inside a pocket.

Elerra pulls out a pebble, turns it into a Tiny Servant, which crawls inside the keyhole of the crate, and it unlocks it from the inside.
Reveals 5GP, 3 small vials of perfume (like samples), palm sized black orb, and his gold and pink mask.
E, to the room: Did you guys make it in, or am I in an empty room on my own?

::spoilers Odessa successfully steals the orb - its the powder of shadows, used in shadow magic::

Sable lets go, walks up to Beau's cell, then drops invisibility.
S: It looks like its been an eventful day
B: Have you come to save me?
S: No.
B: Then why are you here?
S: To ask questions and get answers, and to see why you were stabbing people.
B sighs deeply, and turns his head towards Sable.
B: I already told that lovely tiefling woman everything. You caught me red handed.
B raises his hands, still stained with Ezdi's blood.
Sable taps the bars, just nonchalant.
S: My best understanding - I wanted to work something out here, so we could have a nice progression of everything so it could be smooth, and you went to some extremes, and now I don't really know how we're going to recover from that.
B: Did he survive? Ezdi?
S: Why does that matter?
B: My sister wanted him strung up on the gates, something dramatic. I wanted something quiet, so, my mistake. Won't happen again, promise.
S: You don't need to worry, because he's dead.
Beau smiles a little wider, catching the lie.
S: Maybe we can sort this out, to get you out here, but there's gonna have to be some sort of arrangement made.
B: So you are here to save me?
S: If you ask nicely.
B: I'll do whatever you want, I just need to get out of here.

Elerra's kicked back at the desk, just listening and watching.
Odessa's walked up to the cell, quiet.

O leans against the bars: You never answered his question - why are you stabbing people?
B, as if quoting: To leave the dark is to die in the light. Ezdi came to Shar, accepted her aid. To accept her aid is to become hers. 
Beau is still smiling, looking intently at Odessa.
B: When did you become hers?
O: Never.
Beau is satisfied with that answer, sits back.
O: When did _you_ become hers?
B: I guess I've always been hers, but officially, I performed my secret some 60 years ago now.
O: So why did you stab him?
B: Listen, I don't make the rules, I just follow them.
O: And this rule was?
B: You ask a lot of questions, and I don't feel like answering.
Odessa grabs his chains and yanks him to the cell doors.
O: What if I killed your sister?
Beau visibly flinches at the idea, frowning a little, but trying to maintain face.
B: Loss is fleeting. Only in her arms do we forget.
O: Or what if there was a note to a nearby temple?
B: Write your note.
O: I could do a personal one, direct, maybe.
O: I just want to know why you killed him in such a manner.

Elerra messages the pair: Unless he wants to be right here in this place.
Odessa responds: I'm sorry.

Beau starts stammering some sort of answer.
Odessa rests her other hand through the bars, and a barbed whip fastens around her wrist, revealing Beau's sister, still in her party gear of a long pink dress and veil.
Sable turns, snapping his fingers, and she shimmers for a moment before the effect fades. Sable hides behind Odessa.
Elerra goes to grab the orb in the box - it is no longer in the crate.
Elerra instead grabs a pair of magic handcuffs from behind the desk, misty steps to the sister, then tries to attach the handcuff to the sister's nearby hand, then wrenches the second hand on (using silvery barbs), dematerialising the whip.
As she gets wrenched, the veil lifts, revealing a fairly normal face except for an empty socket where her left eye is, and the same blackened burned brand around it, more ripped and ragged.

Beau kicks out, pushing Odessa away, breaking the chain harness and his handcuffs, to the stone bench.
The sister tries to break out the cuffs, struggling, but fails, manically repeating Shar's tenents.
Elerra is holding a knife to her throat.

Odessa tosses a thin sword at him, through the cell, dealing 53 points of damage.
Odessa can hear, between coughs, Beau is looking up at where his sister is: Stop, please, don't hurt her, I'll tell you everything.

Sable turns to the room: We can stop now, we won, we can stop, please. We don't have to hurt anybody here.
Elerra: We have not won until people are secure.
Sable: We can't just kill them!
The sister is still fighting, aggressively.
Odessa misty steps inside the cell, deanimates the sword, then reanimates it as she holds it up to his throat. Sable raises a hand to halt Odessa.
The sister genuinely does not care if he dies, and she is shouting the 13th truths, her eyes darting around the room.
O: We won't harm a hair on her head, I'll even patch you up a bit, if you _talk._
B looks _bad_, but nods.
Odessa pumps a lil healing hands in him to get him away from death's edge.
Beau immediately starts coughing up blood, a little too scared to move. 
O: _Talk._
Sable lowers his hand.
S: How do I contact Shar without you?
B looks at Sable, honest for the first time: That's never happened to me before. Never spoken to me, never spoken through me-
S: The tools to recreate it, where can I find it?
B: It was just a spell, a generic spell. It wasn't designed to contact her! It will be in my tent, in the same box as the idol.
S: No trick?
B: There's a spell on the lock - either me or my sister could dispel it.

Sister: Take it, I don't need it anyway, I'm ready to die. Kill me!
Elerra: Then I'll make you live, never dying, never free.
Sister continues to the spit the tenents to Elerra, grinning
Sable gags the sister using Elerra's belt.
Beau is following her with his eyes.

O: Some devoted follower of Shar you are. Keep talking.
He talks about the temple he is from - through the Cloaker Cliffs, accessed across a stone bridge. I can take you there. I don't think you'll make it without me, but I can direct you as much as possible.
The sister is now looking at Beau, quite viciously, raging against the traitor.

He talks about Ezdi, that: When Ezdi joined the church, xxx years ago, we - my sister and I - grew close to him, my sister closer than I. He was a friend, and when House Lyzar arrived to 'rescue' him, my sister tried to leave with him. She was caught, and punished accordingly. This is the first ... mission that we have been allowed out on since then. We need to reaffirm our commitment to Shar - if we do not succeed, my sister would likely be killed, probably by me.
Elerra and Sable can tell, in his voice, that he's telling the truth - there might be some unintentional omission, but a note of confusion as he recounts Ezdi's rescue.
O: Why kill him there, kill him then?
Beau cannot help a little flicker of a smile: It was a happy middle, between my choice and my sister's choice of how to kill him. We had a way to get out.
B: The orb that was in my possession can be used to travel through the Shadow Weave. We were going to return to the tent, then the city, then to the church.
S: Why did you even bother entertaining me, even half the time? Showing me the spell, any of it?
B: I thought I could recruit you to the Church. You seemed open to ... Shadow magic, to Shar. I thought you were, I still think you're interesting.

B: My mother is the head of the Church, the Dark Heart. If we return without having killed Ezdi ...
B: I was perhaps going to take a circle of his flesh back, in order to prove his death. She wanted us to bring a piece of him back.

O: Well, it stands that she could deal with a little more loss.
And she goes to kill him, to slit his throat.
It happens, easily. He looks genuinely surprised.
Odessa is blown back a little as his body explodes into a dark powdered mist, breathing in a little bit, and can feel herself retreat back into her mind as her body becomes paralyzed - similar to what happened to the guards when Ezdi got stabbed.
