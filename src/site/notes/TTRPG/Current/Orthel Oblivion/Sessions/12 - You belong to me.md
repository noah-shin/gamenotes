There's a long pause after the MLaval as the mushrooms begin to deliberate.
The Sovereign concedes to the MLaval: The grove is conflicted. Exile is our way, but is not an option. The Lolth-sworn bring the dark when they come, and it worsens when they leave. There must be balance.
The Sovereign feels imploring, looking for a solution.

Sable notices some beginning rot throughout this room as well
He steps towards the throne and can tell its not physical, from poison, age, or arcana - but is mystical somehow.

O steps forward and offers to bring the light instead - to investigate and help cure the rot.
Elerra flares the Fazress in agreement and an offer to help.
MLaval: The darkness we brought was from a lack of understanding between our people. Let me encourage all the lolth-sworn to be spored, so that we can understand each other better.

Sovereign: The Grove is appeased. You will investigate the rot, and the lolth-sworn will be children of the grove. We will hold a myconid melding. The final harvest is almost here, and we will meld with the harvest.
(The Melding is where they share their consciousness entirely, group hallucination thing)

We all leave.

Odessa offers her cuffs to MDeepwater to undo.
She does so, then immediately walks out.

By the carriages outside is the MArcice with Gwynn and Wick.
Gwynn looks mostly recovered, standing in that slinky way of his.
Sable can tell the Matron is disgusted with him, her eyes narrowed. He's pretending he hasn't seen them.

MLaval to E: I respect what you did in their. You must care for the Sovereign greatly. 
E: The Sovereign and the Waters have made the city my home.

MArcice to MDeepwater: Allow me to apologise on behalf of my son's ... pet, for any ill favour. Gwynn is meant to keep him on a tight leash but it seems as though neither has been trained as they should've.
MDeepwater: No I should thank you, he was an asset to House Ilfar.
Odessa steps forward and addresses MArcice: He was also an asset to me and mine. I hope you have an enlightening conversation but
And she slashes down Sable's cheek
O: I look forward to hearing from him again.

MDesor immediately laughs, and all three Wynvri Matrons focus on Sable.
MDesor sniffs at Sable and looks a little confused at Odessa.
MArcice can no longer hide her anger, muttering 'Barbaric'. Gwynn scoffs a little and absent-mindedly raises his hand over his arm where there is a dark bloodstain. He almost looks betrayed.

Sable to MArcice: I have an errand to run, very important that I see it done quickly. Is it possible that I could do that before coming home, please?
MArcice: Excu-
MDeepwater: It is at the request of House Ilfar, this errand.
MArcice: Very well. I expect you back at the apocathery as soon as this errand is completed.

As the Arcices turn away, Odessa sucks the blood off her finger.
MDesor to MArcice: So quick to turn your back on your Queen, remember where you came from.

Odessa steps towards the Wynvri Matrons
MDesor: Not the choice I would've made, but each to their own. I'm sure we'll talk about it later.

We get in a carriage to go to Shelith market
MLaval to Odessa: You should bring your ... friends to the Inn tonight for a dinner. I'd love to get to know the both of them.
O: I'd love nothing more.

In the carriage, Odessa explains the marking, the implications, and asks Sable to represent her name well.
Sable isn't immediately glad, which makes Odessa feel every so slightly hurt.

We arrive at the Market
Head to Beau's stall, deep in the spiral
Surrounding the tent is a thin pink mist radiating for a few inches from the material
Elerra recognises it as an alarm, tainted with Shadow magic

We just head in
Odessa feels Shar's presence under the table, called towards a group of black wooden crates. All but one are piled with perfume, jewellery, makeup. One is piled with papers, a black spiked book, a hand-sized idol of a black disk on a silver stand ringed with purple jewels. The inside of the crate also has a fine black cloud.

Sable looks down at the and whispers: Open it, please.
He repeats himself, louder.
BeauShar materialises on the desk to Sable.
He walks over and dismissively waves a hand, says: My bad
There's a click in the crate, and Sable opens it, reaches in.

He carefully pulls out the book, no effect from the dust.
Some of the silver spikes on the black leather are dark with dried blood.
BeauShar: Go ahead and open it.
Sable does so, immediately flicking through the pages.

It seems to be Beau's diary/journal, over many years.
Each page turned feels like it's invading him with magic - but not of the Weave.
A lot of the earlier pages, his life at the temple of Shar, is a series of drawings of the same sword - long black, shaded and indistinct, full of the occasional void and shadow

Sable snaps his fingers, attempting to evoke a ball of fire
He can tell that the source of magic - the shadow weave - is resisting, but the fire appears, though it is dark.
He then tucks the book inside his wrist-pocket mini-dimension.
His fucked up sight comes back, and he slips his glasses on. His scars are shifting black lines under his skin.
Sable passes the idol to Odessa, who tucks it away

As we leave, BeauShar clears their throat.
BS: They'll be coming for you now. Now you've accessed the book, accessed the Shadow Weave. You'll be fine, but expect company.
S: What kind of company?
BS: Just more of my faithful.
S: Will they try to kill me and my friends?
BS: Depends on you, really.
S: Can I get a hint on what they'll be after.
BS: You, of course. You've accessed my Weave, so they'll just want to give you more.
S: To teach ... there's no harm in that
BS: Maybe a little harm.
S: Thank you very much, that's so insightful
BS: Always helpful.
