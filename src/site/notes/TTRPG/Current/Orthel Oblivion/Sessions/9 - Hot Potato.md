[Noah rolls a d10 -> 8]

A little lightning sparks off Sable's fingertips, watching the shit go down in Beau's cell, a touch angry but more panicked, more anxious.
He gets the keys from Elerra to open the cell, passes them back, heads into the cell (closing the door behind him - not locking)
Standing next to Odessa, prestidigitation to spread the ash back into his footsteps, then casts invisibility on us both.

---

E starts yelling in a commanding voice for Lance and the guards
Sister still fails to escape
Guards arrive
L: What happened?
E: I've never had an issue with your performance before, but this person arrived in here out of nowhere.
(Sister is laughing manically)
L: I - I apologise - I - I can take it from here.
E: There was shouting and magic - I got the cuffs on her, but the prisoner exploded into ash in the scuffle.
L: He ... exploded? (does not believe Elerra)

Lance grabs the sister, pulling her upright, trying to take charge of the situation
L: We need to take this to Matron Deepwater.
One of the other guards runs off to get her.

L: Why is she gagged? 
E: Because she was reciting scriptures from Shar.

Lance goes to lock the sister in a cell, Elerra refuses to give the keys back, so she helps.
(Guards also notice the missing dark orb)

---

Tense silence
8 minutes in - Odessa slowly moves to the front of their consciousness, regaining control over their body, muscles unseizing.
(She can't help a slight gasp of pain - Sable's grip on her arm tightens as he whispers 'Shut the fuck up')

10 minutes in - Matron Deepwater enters, looking tired.
She's shouting at the guard who summoned her, full of fury.

A chill settles in the room with her presence.
E (using hand signals): I promise it was for a good reason. Hear me out, trust me.

MD approaches L, who bows and then recounts everything he knows
MD to E (pained to use this tone w/ her): Just leave, I'll talk to you tomorrow. I can't deal with this.
E hands the keys over to MD, then starts to walk away, kinda angry and disbelieving at her mom's reaction

---

O opens cell door, dropping invisibility
MD startles and pulls out her weapons.

O: Matron Deepwater, don't blame your daughter.
MD: Should I blame you instead?
O: You could.

O allows herself to be arrested.
E goes to stand between the Matron and Odessa

E (to MD): What was it that you always told me to fight for?
MD (pleading): Elerra. Please, _please_ leave.

(Secret: S steals orb from O)

L subtly threatens the cuffs on E. 
O gets cuffed (with the magic cuffs - and the ring stops working)
She gets overwhelmed in her brain and lets out another involuntarily pained noise.
E flinches, terrified of them

E: If you want an explanation, I need to be here. The person who raised me would _never_ threaten to use those cuffs.
MD: Tomorrow. I can't do this tonight.
E steps forward, raising an open palm in invitation.
E: Not tonight. But we go together.
MD takes E's hand (still holding onto her daggers), then a tiny nod, and follows E out.

O winks at E as they leave.
E (private through mushrooms): _Why?_ Do you want to explain now or tomorrow?
O: Whenever you want.

E and MD head home, E leading her the whole way.

O is locked into the cell opposite Beau's sister

Sable tries to use the shoes to get out - but they don't work.
He stealths out, on E and MD's footsteps, then heads into E's room.

He mutters a prayer to Shar
S: I know you noticed me before [...]. If you can make this work, I'm yours.

There's a beat, before his vision grows darker at the edges, then tunnels in, focused on the orb.
There's a presence infront of him.
He looks up, and its Beau - but his irises are black, a mask of feathers around his eyes, and a long black feathered robe.

Sable knows that this is Shar - to be in her presence is to be smothered with intense sadness, and he cannot look away.

She takes his hands where they are cupping the orb.
There's a pressure, stronger and stronger, before his bones begin to creak, then break, then the orb breaks, glass piercing into his hands.

Shar: You're already mine.

Sable can feel his scars of magic grow dry, hollowed out, and without magic.
He blacks out.


#### For next time
Lauren rolled a 5 and 6
