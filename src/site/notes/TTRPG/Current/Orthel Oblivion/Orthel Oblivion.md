> ![lastSession#Summary]


Elerra is waiting at the bottom of the steps for her Mother to descend.
Looking like a disappointed parent lmao.
The Matron doesn't look at Elerra, but moves past her.
M: I have to prepare for the other Matron's arrival. Excuse me.
She steps past, her body radiating cold
E (softly): I suppose that proves how much your word is worth.
M waits a second, before heading out. 

E heads up, clocks O unconscious on the cell floor, which is also covered in ice.
Lance, another guard, and a healer (Cecil, the old guy) comes up with her.
E (to Lance): If I have to ask for this cell door to be opened - Open it _now_.

Lance unlocks the door, and E unfreezes the water and moves it away, giving Cecil some space.
Cecil mostly heals Odessa's legs, and as a bone snaps into place Des wakes up.
For a moment, Des just lies there, silently crying.
As the second bone is set, Des just sits straight up.
Elerra holds a cloak over Des, hiding her from view of the guards.
E (to the guards): If you value your jobs, get _out_.
As Cecil leaves, E gives him a silent thank you.

E goes to wipe Des' face, who flinches away and moves on from the emotion.
O: Your Mother do this to all your prisoners?
E: No, we don't have very many guests, and this is the most out of control I've seen in her in a very long time.

E: Your Matrons are coming, as you have an audience with the Sovereign.
O: ... Ah
E: He won't kill you. He'll exile you.
O: .... Hm.
E: Don't worry, there's a backup plan.
O: What is it?
E: I have to marry Gwynn.
O: Okay, and that's a problem?
E: I want to marry for love.
O: Understood. What's the other big problem?
E: Sable ate the orb. And now he doesn't have magic. And I may or may not have insulted Shar whilst she was in the room. 
O: Can you get Sable here before the Matrons arrive?

E pulls out a sending stone connected to one in her room.
E: Sable, the magicless wizard. Get your ass down here to the cells. You have been summoned. If you get caught, your ass is dead. Elerra.

---

BeauShar has just disappeared, and the matching sending stone on the bedside table chimes.
Sable tries to walk through the corridor like he belongs
He overhears, from the Ballroom, a couple of guards 'Have someone over at the House Arcice apocathery. The Sovereign has also requested his presence.'

---

E leaves her cloak with O, then heads to the entrance of the cells on the bridge.
The guards are all still intimated by E
E escorts Sable across the bridge, both now walking with purpose.

Sable shares a little of what happened - definitely lying about what the cost was
O asks if he can access the Shadow Weave - it's unknown
Shar is definitely in the room

O: Lady of Loss, The Nightsinger, what do you want from us?

Sable can see, from his shadow, BeauShar emerging.
BS: Right now, I just want you to get that book.

Odessa can feel the dark presence intensify, and there's one in front of her and behind her - the one infront is tracked to Sable, the one behind is darker, a near overwhelming void.

Sable: I'll get the book
E: At what cost?
BS: Go on, tell her.
S: Can you all not see ... can you not see your God?
O: When a God tells you to do something, you ... you do it.
S: Ah - okay okay - mhm - I promised you to Shar. I kept it vague and loose, but. 
Sable tries to excuse himself, blaming it on the fact that he was in a near death experience.

::From behind, voice says 'This one also belongs to my patron'.::

E (to Shar): This one had no right to bargain me away. I will spend my life denying any sort of partnership with you.

O finishes basic rituals to both Shar and Lolth.

O: First order will be talking with the Sovereign without being exiled or forcing Elerra into an arranged marriage. Second will be the book.
The sister is trapped in the Shadow Weave, meaning the book should still be secure.

---

Footsteps come back up the stairs
E takes the cloak back from O, who gives it back with a look of gratitude.

Matron Deepwater, Lance, and two guards
M: Sable, is it? Why - we just sent a carriage to the House Arcice apocathery. All three of you have been summoned to see the Sovereign.
M: Your Matrons have arrived, Odessa. We will meet them in the central hall.
Two guards approach with cuffs, Des offers them her hands infront of her.

---

To the central hall
On the way, Odessa stumbles once, a look of pain flashing and she briefly looks at Elerra, before steeling it.

The three other Matrons are being led into the Hall, backlit by blue light pouring in through the door.

::Heyliel, in awe: It's her. It's always been her.::

MDesor starts the greetings.
MDeepwater: I apologise for the ball last night.
MDesor: And we apologise on behalf of -
MLaval: Of my daughter.
etcetc

---

We are sheparded into carriages outside.
Odessa with MDeepwater, Sable and Elerra, and the other Matrons.

MDesor approaches MDeepwater, something in her hand - a dainty silver bracelet sticky with blood.
MDesor: Matron Deepwater! I saw your husband last night at the Widdershins Inn, and the little dancer left all bloodied.
MDeepwater seems shocked, and takes the bracelet.
MDesor: He picked a fight with the band, and a couple other people. Last I saw, he was kicked out to the curb!
MDesor immediately returns to her carriage.

E knows that her father would never pick a fight with others.
E and O note that MDesor does look rather pleased with herself, and not lying about any of the details.

E messages the MDesor: If you're wanting an outcome from a situation, maybe hide your pleasure more when lying.
MDesor (out loud): Lying about what?
E: Oh, did you just say something? Are you okay?

E tries to cast Shape Water to freeze the water to make her slip.
MDesor casts Counterspell and steps forward
MDesor: I said what am I lying about?
E: We haven't spoken much - are you okay?

MLaval: Are you coming Elia?
MDesor goes back and boards her carriage.

Elerra looks like she's about to protest
O through mushroom message, half-defeated: Please.
E gets into her carriage.

---

In Odessa's carriage
After a minute

O: Do you .. feel better?
MDeepwater (honestly): No
O: You can have another crack at it if you want?
M: I've had my fill of torture for the day
O: In that case, do you know why the Sovereign wants the three of us?
M: No clue.
O: Then I presume the outcome of the trial is my exile, correct?
O: Then you should know that your daughter will not allow that exile.
O: Instead, she will agree to marry that man, the one not worth the dirt on shoe.
O: I presume we agree that we cannot allow that.
The Matron recoils, horrified at the idea of Elerra marrying Gwynn.

After a beat
M: I'll take care of it.
O: By that, I hope the result isn't my exile. Because your daughter will go around your back to prevent it, and will marry Gwynn.
M: I'll take care of Gwynn.

---

Odessa lets the mushrooms fully back in

---

In the other carriage

Elerra has her icy mask firmly fixed in place, looking out the window

S: Do you think anyone's going to come for me?
E (not looking over): I would've.
S: I have no right to request it, and you can say no, but if I were to be exiled or murdered or ... not be myself, and you were to remain safe - could you burn any record of Vixroy? You don't have to agree, I just want the request to be known. I would rather the memory die with me.
E: Fire's never been my thing, but I can certainly shatter it in ice.

---

Shortly, we arrive, brick giving way to muddy bark and mushrooms, glowing fauna lining the road.
The road leads to a cluster of impossibly large blue mushrooms, like a living castle, groups of myconids gathered on the various cups, everything breathing in the same rhythm. 
The air is thick with spores, like snow from the cavern ceiling. The mushroom connection becomes clearer, can focus on anyone across the city.
Can sense some kind of argument happening between all the myconids in the city, there's a sense of disagreement.

The carriages pull to a stop, and the doors opened by strange myconids.
MDeepwater is greeted by three robed figures - grey tipped with red and silver belt fastened with the House Lysar sigil.
An older drow woman with long braided hair tied in a low bun, greets us, her voice clear even as her mouth does move, her lips pressed tightly together.

Wirrow - the House Lysar Matron - leads up through a large rotted hole in the clustered stem
Sable can see some smaller signs of rot across the entire cluster, tiny holes perforating the stem.

Inside is a large room, is a large mass of pale blue-white mushroom flesh, 40ft tall, glowing blue for eyes, growing out into the throne, into the room.
Two of the robed figures take spots at the foot of the throne.
Wirrow closer to the front, acting as a megaphone to translate.

Sovereign: We are generous. We opened our grove to those escaping the dark. We opened our grove to you, Lolth-sworn, and the dark has followed. 
(Sable gets the sense that the rot is directly related to the presence of the Wyn'vri refugees)

Sovereign (to Elerra): Child of Ilfar, you are a child of this Grove. With the help of Do'ghym, Ilfar, Auvryath, Arcice, you have helped us understand your people. This understanding has been given to Shelith Market, it cannot be given again.
(Aka the fact we weren't all exiled for killing during the attack on Shelith Market during session 1)

Sovereign (to the trio): Murder opens the Grove to the Dark. Show me the Dark that fell last night.
We all feel a probing from the spores, asking to see our memories.

E: Apologises Sovereign, for memories within drow society, memories are seen as private and personal. We are more than willing to speak on it instead. If not, I am willing to share mine, and mine alone, if that would be acceptable.
There's a hum as the myconids converse, before there's a hum of understanding
Sovereign: You promise to tell the truth?
E nods: Of course, these matters are serious.
Sovereign: Then please, child of Ilfar, tell me what happened last night.

Elerra retells the events of the night, mostly true, just hiding most of the stuff about Shar, trying to emphasize that the killing was done, else Elerra would've been killed.

The myconids all start discussing things again
Sovereign: The grove demands exile. The lolth-sworn must leave immediately.
(He is insinuating not just Odessa, but all the refugees)

Odessa just broadcasts willingness, but also confusion
Aka 'Why are you taking back that which was freely given? Why are you going against a promise you already made?'
Elerra also asks, out loud: Why are you punishing them all for acting to protect someone? To feel loss is the worst kind of pain, to prevent the loss of family, why is it being punished?

Reflected back is just fear and visions of what would happen if the refugees stay - the rotten shell of blue mushrooms, the great myconid clusters dead, the Sovereign rotted away

E: A decision made from fear of a future that has not come to pass is a decision that should not have any weight. This should not be rashly chosen, the refugee future should not be decided out of fear, but over time. 

MLaval steps forward: Sovereign. I am a powerful Seer. I see what is to come, let me show you what will come of exile.
The MDesor is next to her, hand in the small of the MLaval's back, as though supporting her, but her hand is glowing a very faint red.
Through the spores, there is a vision of the Grove rotting, as the refugees are slaughtered outside Orthel, each death furthering the rot.
MLaval: These are your children now, Sovereign. You can't abandon them.
