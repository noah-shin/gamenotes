After a near day after arriving, there is a flurry of movement in the corridor - regimented footsteps that peel away
Each of our doors open to show one person with two guards.
Tara is outside Vio's room
Outside Jupiter's room is a short guy with blonde hair, green eyes - Connor
Outside Unity's room is a old young man with blonde-grey hair, 6' 4, dress slacks
Outside Honey's room is Talon

Honey is brought out first, shooting Talon a look of frustration
Vio is brought out next
Then Jupiter, looking at Connor blankly (they hear a voice in their head going: Glad to see it worked)
Then Unity

Marching order: Jupiter, Unity, Honey, Violetta
Honey memorises the path that they take
Jupiter is looking at everyone, trying to tell if they're _brainwashed_
Unity tries to figure out the young old guy's name. Cringe moment.

Led to end of corridor to a staircase spiralling down.
The floor is concrete - no longer the sterile lab.

There's an old man in a lab coat and a couple other people in the main room.
There's an olympic sized pool in the middle of the room - no water, but stained with blood.
One is Icarus, standing in the back of the room, in a heated-ish argument with someone.

Old Man: The guards are all imbeciles who don't understand good science!

We're lined up against one wall.
Our guards step back, the mutants shooting us each a respective look.
The person Icarus was arguing with scurries away.

Jupiter looks oddly calm, rhythmically jangling their cuffs
Honey doesn't like what's gonna happen but is resolute, shooting glances at Icarus.
Vio is ::spoilers an absence of Being, blankness, but Focussed :: and still partially blind with a focused calm.
Unity looks mixed weary but frazzled, but in great physical health, anxiety hardened into something calculated

Old young man: Tonight's entertainment will be the return of a fan favourite! 
He motions towards a camera that is evidentially broadcasting the room.
Man: We're going to pit our unkillable champion against a newcomer that's been causing a little bit of trouble!
The guards walk up to Honey, who drag them away and into the pit.

Man: And for our champion, the unkillable leader of Team 3, the Icebreaker!
Icarus tries to fight his other team members to lunge at the Pit, but is restrained by them.
A guard comes down to unshackle Honey from the restraining cuffs.

Man: This will either be a very interesting fight or a very quick one.

There's a fight
We kill people
We teleport away.
