Gerald and Connor share a non-verbal conversation
On the surface, it looks like concern and fear about what is about to occur
Honey can't catch who that worry is about, and that the feeling is a little vague and doesn't make total sense, almost performative

Damien comes here to pick us up
On the way out, he shares a glance with Lei (she's concerned about him, of 'I hope you know what you're doing', responded with 'I have to do this')

Led to the intelligence sector with Gerald and Connor
Normally its well looked after and organised, now the walls and pathways have been broken
Can't tell if the destruction is from the attacking party or the rebellion's secret weapon
The bridge between all the sectors has been deliberately destroyed in an act of self-preservation
There is an atmosphere of a lockdown, and it looks like a warzone
People always only move in groups
Normally the base relies on technology and magic, now its very analogue and manual, especially as we get closer to the intelligence sector and base - magic and tech and energy is being damped here

Jupiter is mending some areas of rubble, and even one of the trees
In the trees, they spot a squirrel with butterfly wings, the front teeth like a beavers, and a look of intelligence, squeaking with other creatures in the surrounding vegetation

Intelligence base looks like the first place rebuilt, and further reinforced
Building looks unusually reinforced, guards are hypervigilant

Alanis is currently in his office, talking to some analyst (Beverly)(4' 10 woman, funky pink to orange and blue to green hair)
Bev: We'll try it this new way, but the last 5 or 6 haven't so ... especially as we still can't access technology -
She spots us and trails off, then heads off to another office (doesn't close the door)

Alanis greets them all
Can tell that Connor and Gerald are not just innocent bystanders - had not immediately noticed them, but they have the potentially to be incredibly destructive, power without revealing power, that understated confidence
The Horsemen see the GMT3 pair this way for the first time - this quiet serious source of power

Alanis: And who are you two?
Gerald: Gerald King, leader of one of the GMT teams
Connor: Connor Bradley, part of his team
They guess the prisoners to be members of GMT0, and weapons - nuclear in comparison to us, to any of the GMT teams
Called GMT0, cause the dicks who run the GMT roster based it on roster - 0 was thought to be a myth, but enough happened to people who insulted the concept of that team
Teams used to be on a scale of what used to be 0 to 20

Alanis pokes his head out to ask Beverly to go up the energy dampening - the GMT3 group think that its useful
She goes, and does it well enough, that Vio and Unity both go unconscious...
