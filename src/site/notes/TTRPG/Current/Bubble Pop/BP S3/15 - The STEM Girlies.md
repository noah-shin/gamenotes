mabel to quinn: rescue team delayed. remain where you are. updates to follow.

vio decrypting - there's something wrong with some of the files 
the original files was corrupted before being copied
these are about; connor, gerald, walker, kia kylan (unity), and a gov project
there are additional files (not corrupted) about the end of arc 2
taylor's files have some additional text, that's heavily coded - three different systems and one with an additional variant

jupiter is after files on jason (one of jupiter's dads) and/or violet
there's a file on ja- in the corrupted project, nothing on the full name
there's a file on violetta 
there's a file on violet, updated recently - lab reports (one on hardness scale (mohs) - same as stone: 8.5-9, impact test, heaviness when transformed into stone, thickness of stone layer, conductivity)

honey looks at their own file
ids their mutation, their stint as a soldier, after action report of my final fight (who by? I never wrote one?), linked to walker, strengths and weaknesses, linked to rebellion, notes the 'upcoming fight' between gerald and self, speculation on how the explosion impacted my abilities, speculation on what triggered the explosion, speculation on motives for why I might be a threat to the gov, links to my old teammates (trinity, tal, andra are all dead, renn is alive)

dr carl craig had his fingers in most of the files - signed a lot of reports

unity uses divine sense, eyes slightly glowing a light purple.
there's a figure stood, like their own shadow, recognised from their time at the base
	clocks that unity sees them before shimmering out of existence
walker's glowing  - radiant

everyone else clocks that there was something that unity noticed in their own shadow, but doesn't say anything
quinn: see anything?
u: oh yeah, walker's celestial
quinn: entirely?
u: yea
q to walker: was ma actually an angel then?
walker flicks their eyes to gmt-3, then shakes their head

quinn and unity start a pushup competition
quinn loses by like 5 push ups

quinn goes to chat with walker, gerald, and connor
asks after other bases - walker has no clue
there's a floating island - sky bubble
they go back to it every now and then

the briefing on the rebellion base was there - last year
also briefings for high profile assassinations

their team has been together for five / six months
connor remembers up to eight months
