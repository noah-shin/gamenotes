We all head to intelligence entrance, a fortress
[[Alanis\|Alanis]] (leader of the faction) is running late, then turns up, a lil more armoured, a lil more well dressed, a cool looking dagger (decorative), a wedding band on his finger with a small engraving and made of six different metals, a v confident aura

He lights up a projector and goes into the Intelligence faction
Tells us about our housing, our roles, etc

An alarm sounds, he leaves, very casually.

### Summary

Meet up, and start our new day at the Intelligence Faction of the Rebellion!
