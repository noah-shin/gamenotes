jupiter casts alarm
jupiter and unity share a watch
j: speaking of things being wrong ... you're not going to tell me but ... i saw your sword and ... i thought you were a paladin?
u: is this news to you?
j: your sword has necrotic magic ... why? I'm concerned for you, more than anything else.
j: me and my dad worked with necrotic magic once and it went wrong and half his face ended up withered
u: im no such amatuer went it comes to handling powerful magic
u: if this does cause issues, it won't harm any of the team
j: but it will, because we're a team, and we're not going to abandon you, and we wouldn't want to
u: if you're so worried, why don't you cast ur spell again, and see that the problem is resolved

jupiter can see that walker's wings (the metal specifically) is glowing with an unknown magic type
gerald's coat is abjuration and enchantment
wizard is covered
tempest has abjuration and enchantment on her coat
connor has abjuration on his gloves, jacket has abj and ench, illusion and divination on him
sword is glowing with a necrotic magic (with a purple tinge) (rather than a school, looks like a damage type)
there's a strong sense of necrotic energy nearby that is linked to the sword, that cannot be seen directly

---

walker and honey have a watch
talk about the wings & the celestial nature
each layer of the wings do different things / have extra powers (he doesn't remember exactly what each do)

vio wakes unity (secretly) at the start of their watch with unity
v: be ready

v goes to sit next to connor
v: these files are interesting. a bunch are corrupted, but still interesting
v: you corrupted the files. why?
c: interesting question
c: i didn't corrupt every file on that drive
c: so many failsafes
c: maybe it was just information that you didn't need to see

(corrupted the files from gmt3)

v: you could be one of the gov failsafes ...
c: you just haven't asked the right questions
v: i asked why
c: there are so many reasons
v: i'll take one of them
c: why should you get a peek at my history, their history
v: caring for your team, that makes sense. but if this is only one of the reasons, i'm more concerned about the other reasons. i will uncorrupt the files at some point, and its not meant to be a threat, i just want you to be aware. 
c: you're awfully sure in your abilities
v: i am
c: i'll wait for it to happen
v: i'd say wait to see, but you can't see me coming so ...
c: the interesting thing when you say stuff like that - i can't see you; there's interference there; you are still human, and you do like to involve others, who aren't as hidden from my sight as you might be

he looks directly over at unity

v: forgive me, i don't know the extent of your abilities
c: and you won't

u: now connor, i think you have some information that could be very useful for me, and what i'm looking for
c: but it would the ruin the surprise. what a fun little deal you've made, with so little understanding

vio pulls out a gun

unity places a hand on it to lower it
u: i'm interested in where this conversation may go
u: i'm not the only one here who's made some mistakes and deals in their life
u: what's your goal? what do you gain from this?

c: i only corrupted some, and someone took a look at the rest of the files before the rest of the drive got corrupted (when they got passed to quinn)
c: it's all about perception, a story, isn't it. you never trust the narrator, cause its always so biased
c: things may be written in stone, but that doesn't mean there aren't etchings that change over time

v: you get how this is all threatening, right?
u: no, he's offering me a good time. do you want to meet him?
c: i don't think now is either the time or place for that, he seems to have different plans
u: a shame, we will have to reschedule

u: are you friendly with dr carl craig?
c: i am ... intimately family with him and his work. he is small minded

u: the sky island, i'm thinking of taking a trip up there.
c: primary base and residence for most gmt teams and researchers. somebody is powering its flight (not willingly). heavily protected. above the failed bubble city of fate's hold. there are teleportation tubes to most secured buildings up there, with technological and biological security measures. can't fly to it cause there are movement seeking missiles

u: i don't like that you know so much about me
c: most people don't
u: but I have no interest in making enemies with you, especially when certain members of our team have vested interest in members of you. but you hold knowledge of interest to me. in order for me not to be a liability to my team, i'd be interested in talking to you further
c: what would that give me? what do you offer? also, everyone is a liability, everyone has their weaknesses, their pressure points.
u: what is it that drives you?
v: what's your button?
c, smirking: i suppose you've earned this. i'm driven by chaos, by lies and hidden truths that everyone tries to make. everything has a double meaning, that secret that they're trying so hard to hide. 
u: some of us are here because of love, because of family, of answers. do you desire peace or chaos
c: that depends. there's still chaos in peace - there's never no chaos, no lies, no trickery. 
u: you yearn for the illusion of life then? interesting.
c: take whatever you want from what i've said
