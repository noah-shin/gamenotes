### Summary

We find Alanis as we head through the tunnels back to base
Have a full debrief
Meet up with Josh for a new mission to go to Middlesborough and rescue Taylor
As we drive there, Unity and Vio do _not_ make friends.

</div></div>



Jupiter and Vio go one way, Quinn Unity and Josh go ontop.

Some buildings are a little more intact, a little more settled.
Detect Magic - a number of items around feel like they're losing their magic slowly, like an aura from the city.
Honey notices some recent footprints in the dirt, people are moving in the town, heading towards the middle of the town, probably within the last 24 hours.

Vio notices a lot of movement from the middle of the town to the hidden tunnel.
Jupiter can tell there's an explosive device linked to the latch.

---

Quinn copies Vio's mutation, and also attempts to see the local electricity to check for cameras and the like; cannot see any cameras etc within 45m; and an increase in energy in the device in the latch.
Honey's eyes go bright gold, and Vio's goes electric purple; but the purple is zigzaging down their face, neck, through their clothing, like lichtenburg lines, before they hit the ground and there is a _massive_ explosion of energy. The discharge rod is also destroyed.

This causes the trap to go off, exploding again.
Deals 25 dmg, then 7 dmg, though Unity and Vio crit fail and take 64 damage. (lmao quinn currently has more hit points more than the rest of the party combined)
The dust settles and 12 figures surround us, dressed in black tac gear with machine guns pointed at us, red dots etc

Vio's ears are ringing, and the purple in xir vision is not fading, merging people and things.
Honey's been in this sort of situation before, on the other side. He knows that this is only the first wave, and there are some people in long-distance cover trained on us. These are the black ops groups.
Honey also feels a temperature drop, and the electricity in the air isn't dissipating but being directed. 
	If the cuffs get removed, the energy may get released violently.

The energy is slowly expanding, blocking out the sun, but Honey can see a individual flying with wings, and an eerie laughter.

Everyone puts their hands up and surrenders.

The one in the sky lands, ground cracking beneath him, still laughing.
The guards swarm us, cuffing us with thick mutation-blocking cuffs.
The moment the cuffs click into place, the process of electricity dissipating into the world stops, and starts building up in me.
Unity feels empty, and unusually alone.

Cuffs don't stop other people's mutations affecting us, just stopping it from going out (aka can receive but not respond to a message spell).
Some are mutation only, some are magic only, some are dual purpose. Don't block abilities.
They often have a lock you can pick, but is difficult to reach whilst cuffed.

We are then marched forwards into Middlesborough, past Walker, who has no recognition in their eyes, instead looking almost bored.
Quinn goes to yank slightly, and a smooth deep voice from the cloud: "I wouldn't do that if I were you, Honey."

Vio remembers from the usb of an individual with some capacity of foresight.
Quinn accidently jerks anyway, looking for the voice, then back at Walker.
There's suddenly an individual blocking my path to Walker; 5'10, icy pale skin, dark blue eyes, white short spiky hair, fur lined gloves.
Their hand pushes me back into place in the line - even through the clothing there is a shot of ice and numbness, spreading across his chest, throughout him, dealing 12 cold damage.

Honey smiles up at him, and goes: It's nice to meet you as well, Gerald.
The ice guy doesn't react, only indifference across his face. There's a rush of wind, and a serrated wingtip goes under Quinn's chin.
Quinn: Hi as well, sibling dearest.
Gerald chuckles, mocking, moves the blade, and lift's Quinn's chin: You don't have a sibling, not after you left them behind. You don't get to come here and pick up the pieces.

---

We're taken into the town hall, the ground floor refurbished only enough to stay standing, and walked down a concrete stairwell that just keeps going down.

We're led into a bright white sterile area, doors labelled with numerals. At the end of the corridor, it splits into two - Jupiter and Unity, and Vio and Quinn. We are each placed into individual padded white rooms.

Jupiter notices that the door sits flush with the wall, near hidden, no hinges or handle on the inside. Nine pin lock, with an insert on the inside that hides it. The walls and door are made of metal.



### Summary

We investigate Middlesborough, trip an alarm, get surrounded, and brought down into an evil scientist base.
