### Summary

We start riding (horses) to Aramore, making our way overground
Vio wakes up each morning with too much electricity, shocking Unity
Jupiter begins to build something to help control it.

Jupiter gets affected by the radiation -  seeing family members
Bit of PvP, whoops

</div></div>



Arrive at camp
Honey rounds on Violetta - why???
honey - i get it, but pls ask us for support?
vio - you haven't proven yourself as useful, yet

honey - you're right, we don't want to know each other, and it seems like you don't want to
vio - you're right

everyone sets up
unity scooches their bedroll next to violettas
violetta stares them down
unity : 'i believe your icy facade is merely hiding your deep seated loneliness'

jupiter takes first watch - staring into middle distance
honey checks if violetta is awake, then invites them to next to them
honey offers their trail mix - violetta eats all the raisins & dried fruit
unity takes third watch
violetta stays next to them until half way through, when he goes to bed

---

violetta wakes jupiter for the discharge rod
vio : 'are you good? after yesterday?'
jupiter  : 'everything is fine!'
honey: 'you know that's worse, right?'

jess does something for the skill check
- xe has a building nervous energy - though not from anything specific - whilst we travel

we begin to enter aramore - stealthing
we _barely_ pass the dc

violetta lets us know what building we're after
we start stealthing into it
failure (narrowly avoiding a crit fail)
a city guard calls for jupiter to halt
- everyone gets caught
- but honey hides and is not captured

guards: do yall have any id?
jupiter: what's that?
guard: you know, who you are, where you were born?
jupiter: i don't know where i was born

violetta spits in one guards face
he gets immediately arrested

unity starts flirting and pretending innocence
shows their id - guard looks at it, looks at unity, etc, then scans the id
the guard immediately pulls out a gun and goes : 'put your hands in the air right now'
guard: 'you are under arrest for crimes against the church of helm, and have committed treason against the church'

---

everyone gets taken to this government building
- 45 floors
- same as all the others, very uniform
- grey and slate

as we go in, four guards surrounding one man (wearing these odd cuffs glowing a grey light), with two scientists also flanking him
vio jerks at the sight
unity notices that it's more than a jerk - vio fully stops to look
honey notices a minute exchange between the pair - the eyes lock, the guy looks away, and super subtly shakes his head at vio

guy is 6'3, tanned skin, late 40's early 50s, dull dark red yes with orange flecks, blonde hair with a natural wave falling out of a manbun, looks like he's been through a Lot

honey picks up on a vibe - this is a man who is very protective over violetta, parental authority

honey can see a plain black lanyard on him - ryan matlock
scientists have name badges reading 'flint-ryder', 'dane'
guards have badges reading 'wood', 'wood', 'bane', and 'stone'

jupiter and honey have seen similar designs of these cuffs before
honey has seen them on the front lines
- government deployed mutant soldiers that they had conscripted
jupiter has seen them on 

the cuffs act as a suppressor, preventing them from using their power (doesn't transfer it though, unlike season 1)
- usually glow the colour of the person's power

---

guy is being lead to the door

violetta is pushed along
when he explodes with emotional distress
killing one of the guards
all the guards around the gang are badly hurt

the guards around the stranger stagger
honey fakes a fall, and copies his mutation
- spirit animals & pack bonds

*hidden stuff was here*

honey picks themself up, faking apologies
and picks the stranger's handcuffs

guy suddenly rapidly heals
summons the spirit animals to start attacking (quinn mirrors him)
guy: 'vio, get your ass in gear!'

jupiter sets off the discharge rod
it chains lightning most of the guards (15 out of 20), dealing 49 dmg, burning and killing them
jupiter starts cackling like a mad scientist

violetta rushes to the front desk to hack it and collect as much data as possible

honey picks unity's locks, accidentally touches them
copies their mutation

*hidden stuff was here*

unity casts black tentacles
they grow out the ground and grapple the guards remaining in the room

jupiter shoots electricity in a line through the ones trapped
the stranger's wolf tears through the final one next to the clone of honey

honey is on one knee, starting to hyperventilate
he gets dragged along, and the training kicks in enough that he runs, but his eyes are glazed over

we head into the armoured van, ryan behind the wheel, and we zoom off

### Summary

We enter into Aramore
And get caught pretty much immediately lmao
Vio recognises someone being taken out of the government building we were supposed to infiltrate
We proceed to break them out and make our escape!
