### Summary

After a day, we're all gathered together and taken down into a sterile lab
Quinn gets shoved into a pit fight with iceguy
Before the gang break out of their cuffs and we all begin fighting, killing all the guards in the room
Before teleporting away!

</div></div>



We've landed in a forest - the radiation is at the end of the forest - 25 miles ot the west
These are the forests outside of Aramore

Jupiter starts casting Revivify
Walker approaches, dropping to his knees
	They take out a figurine of the pair, hand in hand, almost like a wedding topper
	Say: You don't get to leave me before we get to use this

The other members approach, providing an object each
	Tara - piece of fabric, like a ribbon, slightly frosted - has conjuration magic
Two others do something else

Vio goes to become a human defibrilator - should abort at the last second because something is going wrong.
Quinn gives the ring back

There's a moment - think he's dead
Then there's a weak groan
Connor gives us spare masks, our mobiles, and our weapons back

Unity does detect magic
	tara's necklace has conjuration
	walker's wings are 
	connor's bag (bag of holding)

jupiter puts up an alarm
unity texts josh - hiiiii sorry for looking thru ur stuff, r u alive? plz respond
josh - Hello. No need to apologise Violetta. Have you guys escaped? I need to know where you are. Josh.
unity - We are in Aramore woods. Camping.
josh - How did you get to Aramore woods from Middlesborough? Josh.
unity - tp
josh - Tp? Josh.
unity - I don't know either xoxo
josh - Is anyone harmed? Are you safe? Josh.
unity - yes, someone died, but he got better
josh - Who died? Josh.
unity (as a voicenote) - we found some new friends, don't know who they are, but they're cool. He died.
josh - Apologies Unity. New friends? I will redirect the rescue team to your new location. Josh.
unity sends a selfie back, peace sign, in bg is the rest of the group, in their various states of disarray
josh - Will direct the rescue team now. Stay put. Josh.

walker and honey take first watch
honey crying for a while, then slowly sits up, takes them in
	they're a lot taller than before, now 5' 9
	slightly paler than before, longer hair, less maintained look
	and a bit of a void of emotion behind their eyes
	can't stop look at the wings, and how different they are

honey: i'm sorry it took me so, so godamn long to find you
walker unclasps the mask, revealing some scars - dots - across the lower half of his face, and his voice is gravely, hoarse, husky, etc - from disuse and overuse (the laughing, screaming?)
walker: yeah, took a while
honey just talks - the entire story from the accident to gerald's talk about the pit
about the team, walker says quietly: i gained a big sister, and two big brothers from my team.
honey: and maybe one who means something more?
walker blushes, the way they used to
honey: don't worry, i met them all for all of two minutes, and i couldn't leave them behind either
walker: they have a way of getting under your skin
honey: mine too

---

unity and jupiter take next watch
swap stories
	jupiter about a lab explosion
	unity about pranks from the old paladin
unity's sword isn't from the paladins - given to them from someone

---

tara and talon take next, pranking each other with the most subtle spell they can do

---

connor and vio
vio: how long have you been with the government, mr foresight?
connor: 4 years
vio: p long time, huh. question 2, what is the gmt?
connor: government mutant team, and we're the gmt 3. the gmu is the government mutant unit. there's 15 total, 8 active, 5 on hold, 2 deceased.
vio: should I be offering my condolences?
connor: we're not close. to clarify, the active team members change quite regularly based on deaths.
vio: how did you come to join the government?
connor: i applied to join the government, and i ended up here. was a mutant before, and put it on my application. 
vio: why? the government notoriously doesn't treat people that well
connor: because of the way my mutation works, there are times that i gain information without it being of any use, but i have no way of knowing that. i just knew i needed to be around for something
i needed to have access to a certain thing at a certain time.
connor: there's no reason for me to convince the rest to defect. there's a lot of things ... they did to us.
connor (about his mutation): it's a strange thing - i don't see everything. if i try to focus on a thing, i can, some things are automatic, some things i have to search for, it varies, and is hard to  ... hard to - sometimes i can see things and sometimes i can't. it depends on how planned something is, a lot of time. i might get a second warning, if its impulsive - it depends on the forethought that goes into a situation
vio: say, hypothetically, if someone was assassinated in the group, would you see the assassin?
connor: it depends on the planning - i could probably see an ambush down the road, but less spur of the moment stuff
connor: i will go wherever gerald goes, and gerald goes wherever walker goes
vio: so walker's kinda the head? the leader?
connor: it's gerald
vio: oh yes, because they're dating. how did that go? 
connor: to my knowledge, the gov didn't know. if they did, they would've done something
vio: i'm just trying to see how valuable you are to the government
connor: eh, you don't want to come across gmt-1 - two of their codenames are War and Death, the others were the Huntsmen, and Shadows
vio: lmao we're also the horsemen - honey is war, unity was death, vio was famine, jupiter was pestilience
vio: i just wanted to know if we could trust you before inviting you back to the rebellion base
connor: oh, the one beneath angelos?
vio: oh, why haven't the gov sprung us?
connor: only i know this secret

next morning, honey checks his phone
from mabel - basic check in, then 'rescue team incoming, is everyone okay' (after unity had texted josh)
quinn texts back, informs her about stuff, gets told to stick around

then as honey makes breakfast for everyone, asks connor 'we were there for another friend of ours'
honey explains who she is, and a bit of why it would be bad for her to be caught
connor only knows about her mutation

---

vio squeezes quinn's shoulders, hooks chin over: down for some discharging baby? i need to
some innuendo talk
vio hits quinn for 20 points of dmg

---

gerald only knows she was at the base, some chatter of her movement
get out the lil book again - it has a sd card tucked inside - slot it inside vio's tablet
vio spends an hour unencrypting it

---

unity muses to the entire camp: hey, did any of you meet a young old man in a labcoat that may have tortured you?
talon: do you have a better description?
unity: sure, but i was being tortured at the time. 
talon: dr carl craig
unity: friend of yours?
talon: he was no-one's friend, except head of gov, macintyre
unity: he took a vested interest in my vitality
talon: that's his schtick, he's a weird one
