v: are you a god, connor?
c raises a finger to his lips and winks, before leaving
most of the gods decided humanity wasn't worth saving, but the utter chaos that erupted - there are things on this plane that required my attention .. my protection
v: things like walker? our resident celetial?
c: its an interesting story, the path humanity has taken to enticing some of its gods back. i hear lady luck has returned, helm was interested but mostly deserted. who's to say what's, or who, is bringing me around
v: don't suppose you could send some of the protection my way? not that i really fuck with gods, but
v: asking for proof feels immature but i like my hard facts
god of lies, mischief, chaos, strife
c: good to meet you. i'm loki.
