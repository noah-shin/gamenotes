### Summary

We enter into Aramore
And get caught pretty much immediately lmao
Vio recognises someone being taken out of the government building we were supposed to infiltrate
We proceed to break them out and make our escape!

</div></div>



quinn wakes up to the van backfiring
ryan has just ... gone to do something

turn on the radio in the awkward silence
'breaking news, attack on the capitol, in this police van, by these people - reads out the names we gave them' - molly's id was 'kia klyan'
'10k reward for any info regarding the treason of a top tier gov individual' - describing ryan

violetta : yeah i don't trust ryan
quinn : yeah that's the biggest load of horseshit. you know his whole shtick is that he cares so much about you, right?
violetta : .... yeah i know nothing about him

quinn goes back to a halfnap
unity starts trying to do something - holding the sword, almost reverent, then in a movement like cleaning it, the two whole and one cracked gem becomes one whole and two cracked, and both of us in the back (unity and quinn) feel this gentle breeze from nowhere when it cracks

---

when night comes, quinn and violetta switch spots (climbing through the middle), and quinn drives through the night

quinn and jupiter start chatting
jupiter : 'we lived outside society, in our own space. the government doesn't like that, and sometimes you have to run away while tossing experimental grenades behind you, and you don't check whether or not they're dead'

they have a crack convo about needing to change our looks, maybe dye our hair. did you know green hair increases your fishing luck. what.

---

unity and violetta notice that the white in unity's hair has become a silvery shimmer

violetta's eyes light up a lil bit - as if noticing the electrons in the air - and see a trail of energy from the crack of the gem 

violetta : how . how are you . how is the sword
unity : i am fine, you don't have to worry. i made a deal, i will deal with the consequences

---

end up switching w/ unity and violetta up front and jupiter and quinn sleeping in the back
jupiter and quinn both make will saves

*hidden stuff was here*

---

after a while, violetta hits a flow
then crashes into an obstacle on the road
jerking jupiter and quinn awake, though both manage to catch themselves

violetta and unity realise they'd hit a tree branch overgrown on the road
the car restarts, though the right headlight is down

quinn starts to drive - jupiter and unity spreading out in the back
and get us to outside of fates' hold

---

once we get there, everyone gets out of the van
quinn ties everyone together, then we go looking for another car
- gets a nat 20 for the roll
- quinn is now canonically a rigger lmao

we drive the van to the identified working car
violetta starts sucking the coolant to transfer it
chokes, gags, accidentally breathes the air
then grabs unity in a chokehold, electrocuting them at the same time
before shooting jupiter and quinn

### Summary

We make our way out
Not many convos, just awkwardness, attempted conversation, doesn't get very far
We pull over to get some more gas, Vio breathes in the radioactive air, and starts another round of PvP
