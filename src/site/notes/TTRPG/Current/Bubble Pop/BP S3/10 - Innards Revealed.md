### Summary

We get back to the Rebellion base
Al has a chat with Unity and Vio
Quinn and Jupiter have a heart-to-heart and meet Jupiter's dad!
Quinn makes it back to see Unity and Vio exchange something, then start making out

</div></div>



kia leaves a second cup of coffee for vio every morning

near end of downtime, we meet up to have family dinner
jupiter, offering a taco to vio : i'm sorry for stabbing you in the chest

jupiter: maybe we should improve our communication?
vio: yeah, we don't really ... know anything about each other

2 truths 1 lie

quinn goes first, talks about walker

jupiter : when i was growing up , my family had to run away from the government multiple times
jupiter : my dad and sister are currently missing
jupiter : i fucking love pickles
jupiter : i miss my dad jason very much, jasper (other sibling) works in the humanitarian sector
jupiter : i went and had a meeting with robert, and he helped me track down their mutation energy signatures
jupiter : they're hopefully not in darkpit, but we don't know, cause its all demon energy. they're most likely in middlesborough
jupiter : i'm pretty good friends with taylor, cause i was born in middlesborough
jupiter : they went missing when we had to flee into the irradiated wasted from our home of the science ranch, about a year ago

vio : i grew up a big gov groupie
vio : i don't like peaches
vio : i am an only child
vio : and up till a week ago i thought they were all true

unity has personal history with necromancy?
unity : i was not the only one on the other side, i was once one of those paladins of helm
unity : but there's a reason i'm here now and not with them

vio : i never worked with the mutant experiments
vio: but i have family that are not really family, but who work in the gov in unspecified roles

unity : i have never witnessed someone from my family dying
unity : i have a lost sibling (lie)
unity : and i love peaches

---

later the next week, head to a training room to figure out each other's play styles

quinn goes first, displaying flurry of blows and stunning strike
jupiter goes next, hitting w/ their short sword, dragon breathing a line of fire, then one overdrive megabolt
jupiter : if you see the dragon open its mouth, stay away, unless i'm healing you

vio pulls out a bunch of guns
vio : i'm a very sneaky shooty guy
vio : and i've been training with taylor to get better control over mutation - so i can charge weapons,  and can do a grenade attack thing that arcs off

unity imbues their weapon w/ some energy, before striking, which causes a line of darkness to pass between them
then there's multiple version that all strike at the same time

---

mabel summons us for a meeting, for another mission

recon missions in fates hold, darkpit, and middlesborough

we all get fake ids
quinn - hawthorn march
jupiter - holly lancefield
grapefanta - smith steven mcson
unity - brielle leicester
vio - scarlette white

we each get x2 masks, x2 healing potions

---

jupiter spends the night checking the masks, before we head off the next morning

head through the underground
walking, camping through the evening with a watch schedule - vio, jupiter, quinn, kia

jupiter gets distracted by a moth
quinn wakes up to the sound and light people searching ? parallel to us - but moves past of us
second patrol during quinn's watch - able to keep track of a few different pairs of uniformed patrols

second night
jupiter's watch, the patrol notices a noise
jupiter tries to persuade them that we were an innocent refugee family
utterly failed to convince one

now in initiative

### Summary

Have a family dinner - share our missing siblings and tragic family history
Go for training to figure each other out, and how we work
Head off to Middlesborough for a mission
Second night of walking through the underground - oops the watch spot us

</div></div>



Start in combat with the two people on patrol
Unity infects one with worms and Murders him, then pulls all the blood out the other (70 damage on someone with <30 hp)
angelos gets alerted to our presence, and we have to bug out

vio leads us in the wrong direction, and we finally stop at midnight
we start to set up camp
jupiter sets up an alarm thing

jupiter and honey go to bed
unity gives vio the memory stick back
vio notices that unity may have looked at the contents
then unity goes to bed

jess spends an eon in secrets

---

alanis notices that taylor left the base
she'd left a note - she's been cooped up and went into the tunnels beneath angelo
where later, alanis would learn, that guards are now searching the area (cause of the gang)
mobilises everyone

---

vio ends watch
puts a dogtag on unity's pillow and goes to bed

quinn wakes to a text from their handler : stay in area, but angelos is hot
texts back : recieved
then goes back to bed

unity sits in silence for their watch, clutching the dogtags

during quinn's watch, he gets another message : did anything happen when you were leaving angelos?
quinn gives full and brief report - each day, that they left a pair of distinctly mutilated bodies, and where they currently are

---

everyone wakes to an alert from alanis - a top level alert, continue operating as normal unless informed otherwise, taylor was last seen under angelos tunnels

jupiter bursts into tears about the news about taylor

vio starts a group meeting - he has learnt a Lot from last night
vio shares the memory stick, and some of the info on it
	some info about missing siblings?
	there's a big folder labeled 'GMT'
	filled with codes for subjects, or projects, or experiments - about 6
	one on **Icarus**
		their wings were experimented on to replace feather with bone and metal
		an active agent
		a quote 'It keeps laughing' - a potential side effect
	one on **Stone** 
		much emptier file
		still testing their abilities / mutation
		recommended for their 'attack team'
	they have a whole file on Victoria Prescott
		updated with her recent known locations
		and accessed by the head of the government
	and another one in middlesborough
		there's a huge government research base underneath middlesborough
		unrelated to the sibling experiments ?
		still active, and put up when middlesborough fell
	and (with a pointed look at unity) nothing else

unity : whatever you think you have over me, violetta, you don't
vio just shrugs
unity : you and I will be talking, alone, whether you like it or not

honey informs the gang about the change in plan

unity : why didn't you mention that alanis was in danger too?
vio : what do you mean by that? something to share? a deep and intimate betrayal?
unity : i - i didn't look through that much. i didn't look at anything regarding you, or the experiments, just alanis, and taylor. I'm sorry, and you're welcome to hate me, and I'm sorry I fucked up the coffee for two weeks straight!
vio : maybe you should let the group decide about group preservation

unity shares about alanis' file
	the gov are keeping a close eye on al due to his closeness with taylor
	it may not just be taylor that they want
	a transcript of a call in darkpit
	their weakness, etc

quinn goes to text the handler about the fact taylor is mostly likely alanis bait
	as a warning, the head should stay behind. this scenario reeks of alanis bait
she texts back
	head team went dark 45 minutes ago.
	all agents recalled, return to base, avoid angelos.
	[instructions on how to access the base from the back]
quinn goes
	received
	this shit's more fucked than our first training, right
mabel goes
	don't even mention that disgusting incident again
	get your asses back

### Summary

We kill the two people on patrol, then flee through the tunnels, getting lost and ending in the wrong direction
We wake to a text that alanis has put out a top level alert, and that taylor (then Alanis) are missing
We stay put, and Vio shares their memory stick - and the info on it
We decide to head back to the base
