There's a tech deadzone around the base.
The doors in the tunnels are an illusion
Unity and Jupiter walk through, and Unity gets stuck half-way through the wall illusion
Jupiter realises if they phase through, they might get harmed
They recognise the device as causing a magic stuck-ness, but that it's also an alarm

First guy comes
End up calling another guy
End up calling _another_ guy
Lei and Damien finally turn up
Quinn explains the situation, and we finally all pass through

We can see a lot of destruction, a clear fight
The rebellion used a weapon they hadn't before - one Taylor insisted that they create
The base had been tipped off by an insider source about the upcoming attack
There's a thicker deadzone around the Intelligence sector

The attackers escaped through energy, though two have been held captive
Mabel and Steven are out of base to keep connection
Alanis is also very busy

We go to ask GMT3 for their help identifying the pair
Damien and Gerald nearly shake hands
Damien leaves, and Quinn presents the offer
Everyone looks kinda scared at the description (Violetta can tell its almost performative)
Gerald: That sounds like GMT0. You captured them?
G: Did you capture them or did they want to be captured?

Gerald and Conner offer to come with - as long as the prisoners don't see them
We stay in the infirmary room until the intelligence sector is ready for our visit
