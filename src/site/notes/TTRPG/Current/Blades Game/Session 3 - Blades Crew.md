It's been a few days since the Railway Massacre

Wools goes to talk to Fitz
Butler lets him in, resigned. Hallway lined with artifacts from around the world.
Fitz has no clue who Franco is. Or the link with the password.
The tattoo is of the Iruvian assassins - ah, it's cause we killed the Iruvians in the Red Sashes in the first session.

Red finds out that some working girls who've been found cut up and murdered recently.

We're gathering informants - aiming for Red's connections
Offer our support and protection to the Red Lamp in exchange for information.
Woman in charge of Red Lamp (Silkshore) is Madame Tesslyn
We all rent a gondola to head over
Take the staff entrance in
Red flutters her eyes at the security at the office door to get Sestra's gun through secretly

Madame Jennifer Tesslyn is a woman in her 50s, curled hair, in a nice skirt that covers her ankles, black blouse, a pin of flowers in her hair. 
The girls dead were Sarah and Palin (?).
Killed by the Billhooks - Sarah and Palin used to go see Coran (who's dad was in the Billhooks and recently got arrested), and the murders were quite grisly.
Ever since Tarvul (the leader) got arrested, Coran's done his own thing, expanding them wherever, doesn't go as much to the butcher's shop anymore. Tarvul's sister Erin still holds the loyalty of a significant part of the gang.

We get rid of Coran, we get the informants.
Help Erin, we might strike a deal there as well.
Coran has a den down the river next to an Iruvian mushroom shop.
Erin will be in the butcher's shop in the docks

Head the docks
It's a pub called the Butcher's Shop
Hooks hanging from the ceiling, some with blood
Various people with hatchets covered in dried blood

Walk in, talk to the Bartender

Erin - black hair in ponytail, scar from top of temple to jaw on other side, coat with 'Billhooks United'
Takes us to the back - room with big table and chairs all round it - gets us four pints
We agree to kill Coran - not connecting the murder to her - for 2 Coin, and we get a job in the future.
Spit on a handshake.

Head to the docks
Sestra tries to do some reconnaissance - gets spotted watching, doesn't see anything
Red gets confirmation from a ghost that the boss is on the top floor

We get to the roof of the following building - risky start
We're at the roof - two men sleeping inside
Wools steals their weapons (meat cleavers)
We tie them to the bed

Outside the room is a staircase down, leading to a candle-lit corridor
Wools turns invisible and starts to flit in and out of the doors along the corridor (in their ghost form)
One room full of boxes (Iruvian Mercentile Group, and Basran's Goods) full of mushroom
Next room has a table - one end is a man with a dark ponytail, bit of a beard, with four other people in conversation with him.

Sestra opens the door, shooting Coran through the head
Red drops a spirit bottle through the ceiling onto the table
	The ghost is a young-ish adult who was stabbed to death

We flee over the rooftops, shooting a staircase and a guy in the shoulder along the way.
The Bluecoats notice from the streets, but they're blocked by some of the sex workers along the road, allowing us to escape freely.
