Roric, the  Crow's boss has been murdered
Lyssa, his second, has taken over

The uneasy peace between the Lampblacks and Red Sashes fractures, as the peace Roric had brokered between them explodes, and there is a three-way war between them and the Bluecoats.

Bunch of guys grab us from a pub and blindfold us, before bringing us to Bazso Baz.

We agree to help him out against the Red Sashes - to steal their Treasury.
	Their HQ is in the basement of the shop 'The Horseman's Dog' within Crow's Foot

Baszo shakes a Ghost Contract for it with Veta and Irina.

We go steal a boat to take to the shop
	Wools goes invisible after kicking the boat off
Find blueprints to the shop in the Library

We get the boat to the back of the shop
Manage to lockpick the window, but it opens with a loud screech

We start to make our way downstairs
Manage to get the steel door unlocked

In the room beyond are two guards playing cards
Veta kills one
Irina knocks the other out, but they kick out, causing a fire
Irina uses the body to put out the fire, and Veta pushes the blood on the table (from her body) to staunch the spreading fire on the table leg.

Wools opens the next door, opening to a war stash
6 bags, each worth 2 Coin
On the way out, Wools also pockets a little mirror and an expensive looking doll

Three guys break through the door
Irina shoots the first two, then tosses a gun at the third, knocking them out

Veta draws on the wall, opening a passage through the wall to the boat on the other side
We load the boat up, and get out of dodge

---

The mirror is haunted
	Whenever someone looks into it, their image is distorted, and they can't help looking at themselves, stuck in a trance

We name the boat Ms. Direction

We train, reduce heat, and Wools indulges his vice.

We end up all chatting with each other, trying to figure out which things are true
Wools watches Irina spar, then asks if there's anything else in her bed.
