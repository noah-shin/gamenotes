Arrived back at base, there's a parrot sat on the desk - its Fitz's
"I hear you've been looking for Basran" (The Red Sashes leader - his son was Franco)
"He's annoyed me a bit - sold off my brother. He's in Brightstone. Financially ruin him."
The parrot then flies through the wall.

Downtime
Wools trains (a Ghost pottery moment with Sestra)
Wools plants some rumours
Sestra puts the Bluecoats on the Skovlander refugees
Red develops occult rituals

Although Crows leader (Rorick) 'died', no-one has seen the body, and no Spirit Wardens turned up to collect it. Rumour is that his ghost haunts Crows' Foot.
One of the last people to be seen with him was Lyssa.

We go to steal the Crow's War Chest - bombing one of their gambling dens as a distraction
Walk through a wall (with the chalk) into the kitchen
Dress up as the servants
Get upstairs
Sneak in, parrot appears, drop a silence potion, start stealing the shit
Get the War Chest out the window with climbing gear
Escape!
