There's a knock at the door - then someone enters
Man in his late 50s, 5'11, balding white wild hair, in a suit, couple of watches on one arm, rings on the other, monocle, with a cane
Wools recognises him as a fixer - the contractor we sold (and who returned) the haunted mirror

He offers us a job - he has an Iruvian artifact, and needs someone to pick it up for me
From Whitechurch - from rail gondola
Has a feeling someone's been watching him

Wools picks his pocket - takes a cigarette and a beetle from his pocket, and a watch

Password - *A father's vengeance knows no bounds*
(To pick up the parcel)

Wools take a ring as well

---

Wools tries to dress up as Fitz in order to see who's been watching him
Gets bullied by local kids
Red tries to kick one - gets caught by the paparazzi

---

Sestra scouts out the Nightmarket and Gadoc Rail Station

---

We get to the Station, there's a man waiting, scarily still, hands ontop of a briefcase.
Red says the password
He hands the briefcase over - then says '*Vengeance is ours*' - and stabs Red
(We notice there aren't _any_ Bluecoat's around)

Sestra shoots the guy - hitting the hand with the knife
Wools tries to leap at the guy, but a second attacker grabs Wools and pins him
Wools goes ghost mode and gets out
Red has a ghost bottle and convinces the ghost to possess the guy - who starts contorting, bones breaking

We split up
Sestra gets jumped
Manages to kill the attacker - who has a tattoo of a pentagram with a crown above it

Wools gets knifed out the blue
Gets away

Red gets spotted - accused of: *You thought you could get away with killing Franco?*
He sets off a trap she'd set - a rope trap that snares his ankle
She collects some of his blood, then runs off

We all make it to the meetup in Nightmarket
Then make it back to the Clocktower

Interrogate Fitz
Red choking him out, Sestra mad about the betrayal
Buyer was an Iruvian - Lord Basran
He knows the tattoo - Royal sigil for assassins of noble Iruvian houses
Doesn't know Franco

Red investigates the briefcase
Ends up opening it
Inside is a bronze lamp
Fitz says its a genie lamp
Red can sense that it wants out - excited, not angry

We get paid 6 coin for all this

---

Bluecoats grab Red that evening - interrogating her about what happened that evening
Pays them off

Wools hires a doctor to make a house visit - spends both downtimes to heal
Sestra also heals a bit, and does some religion
Red reduces heat and does long term project
