We've decided our team name! The Midnighters!

We go to the **Lampblacks** factory, want to see how we can help them finally win the war
Meet their second - **Pickett**
They're having issues with the smaller gangs in **Coalridge** and **Crow's Foot**
The **Penny Pinchers** aren't paying their tribute
- Worth 6 Coin
- If we get it back, we get 2 Coin
- Got to put a lantern where the money is
- Can steal or threaten it out, just don't kill anyone
- They work out of Tangletown

We head to **Tangletown**, which is built on the back of the wrecked Leviathan Hunter 'The Nautilus'
An orphan spots us as we pass through Crow's Foot - runs to the **Red Sash Academy**

We're stopped by Bluecoats
- Pay them 2 Coin
- Get a permit to walk in Crow's Foot for the day
- Get a paper that says we paid our taxes

We land on the Nautilus
Head to the Captain's Quarter's for information
Pinchers are on the lower decks, operating out of the kitchens, with a port to a rowboat
They sell **Whisper's Delight** (WD, Oodie), which is a bit like meth and used to connect you to the Veil

Wools grapples down the side of the boat, into the storage room
Sestra & Red enter the main room, meeting a big bat guy and a dual gun girl
S: You owe money. We are here to collect tribute. This is your chance.
Heavily implied that they actually owe the money to **someone** else?

In the back, someone is distilling the ghost essence
Wools sneaks past, steals their money
Gets back onto the rowboat & also leaves with a ton of their supply (WD)

![Session 5 - Blades Crew Map.jpg|250](/img/user/TTRPG/Current/Blades%20Game/Session%205%20-%20Blades%20Crew%20Map.jpg)

We start rowing back to the Lampblacks in Coalridge
**Bluecoat** boat comes alongside
Sestra pays 1 Coin to make them leave

We drop off the Pincher's tribute
No **Baz** around still
We get our 2 Coin (goes to Sestra & Red)

+2 Heat

Wools goes to the theatre, noticeably out of place
On his way home, the **Bluecoats** grab Wools, bundling him into a van
They want to know whether the **Lampblacks** are.
Believe that Wools doesn't know anything lmao
Beat him up and let him go.
He goes to Dunridge & Sons to buy a nice tailored outfit for the next time he goes out

Sestra does some worship and tries to heal her wounds

Red takes some WD
Hears a voice: **Mirak**.
A monstrous image flashes in her head, like a Beholder but with a wide grin instead of a central eye, translucent skin with the Northern Lights shifting underneath.
He offers Red a job - a *puppet* of theirs has been wrongly accused of murder. He is due to be in court in a few days, and must be removed from the situation (in any way possible)
If she does it, Mirak will owe her a favour.

Red also reduces heat, painting some false Wanted posted.
