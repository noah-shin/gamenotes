Wake up
Osmo has a Tawny Owl
Head down to join Sildar eating breakfast tortillas

Plan the day
- deliver goods
- deal with red brands
- maybe find gundren

Innkeep wife - Poor Fell Dendra last week stood up to the Red Brands, then they killed him
His wife, daughter, and son have not been seen since

---

Head to Barthen's
Get 10GP each

If we get his goatskin, get 37.5GP each now, the other half later
the red brands hassle everyone but the Miner's exchange
purchase some stuff

---

Head to Mayor's
Has bounties
	Reward: Orcs near Wyvern Tor

Enter, see an older man in a nice suit
	Mayor Harben Wester

Red Brands are a mercenary guild in the area
	He acts like they're not that bad
	Is actually genuinely terrified of them

They're up in Tresendar Manor
	5k GP worth if reclaimed

---

Head to Sleeping Giant taphouse
	In a rougher part of town
	Notice four ruffians lingering on the front porch with grimy scarlet cloaks

Ruffians: Here's a whole pack of puppies, here to bark at us?
Felni becomes a brown bear
They all immediately go silent, shitting themselves, now Frightened

Satine: We've come here to talk. Not to you, but go get your boss.
Ruffian: You want to speak to Glassstaff?
Osmo speaks into his mind to convince him
He runs off to go grab the boss.

---

We head into the taphouse, full of shady characters - none are wearing red
Behind bar is a dwarf named Christer.
We all decide to sneak around the back and circle to the Manor - hoping to take it whilst its emptier

The Manor looks long empty and overgrown
Osmo notices, through a gap in the wall, that the inside looks worse, with a very good trapdoor.
Kestrel squeezes through - stairs are broken, and no other rooms
Osmo and Felni follow
Satine tries, trips, clanging as she goes through.

Open the cellar door
Open room
There's a rope in the cistern - attached to a waterproof satchel
	Potion of Healing, Potion of Invisibility, 50GP, clothes (ordinary traveling)

Head through the door on the left - storeroom turned into makeshift living quarters
One Red Brand - Kestrel chokes them out
	Gets 16 SP, 7GP, 2 garnets (10GP each)
Everyone's wearing red cloaks we picked up

Head through door in the north
Floor is thick with dust
	A tarp 10ft from the door
Relief of an angel on thick copper doors at the end

Other side of the door are three sarcophagi
Propped up against each is a human skeleton in bits of rusty mail
We open the door - not attacked cause we're wearing the scarves

Door to the north and to the right
We go right - leading to the prisons
The family talked about earlier are held within
Two guards within
Guards : Oh, you're new!
Kestrel : Yeah, there's a two for one special. You've been promoted to take advantage.
Guards bugger off

Osmo picks the first lock
Then the second
Satine walks them through as her 'prisoners'
They tell her of a treasure in Thundertree - an emerald necklace inside an alchemy shop.
Also tell her of Glassstaff -he's a wizard, with a couple bugbear pals.

Door to the north - armory
Locked
Osmo breaks his tools
Felni also fails to open it
Satine notices a little loose cobblestone
Pressing it, there's a secret door that opens

Another storage room
	Contains 30 beaver pelts (2GP each) - we don't take them

Big cavern - couple of bridges across it
Loops back to beginning at the bottom
A creature at the other exit at the bottom - Nothic

Kestrel hears a voice in his head, begging for food
Knows the creature type
	A mage that has made a pact with Vecna, and now don't remember their past lives but are always looking for forbidden knowledge

Felni becomes a bear
We kill the poor nothic
	Get a Nothic eye
	And a chest with some gold, gems, potions, Talon sword, and spell scroll of augury

Can see a way out through these natural caverns - in the base

Owl listens through Door number 9.
