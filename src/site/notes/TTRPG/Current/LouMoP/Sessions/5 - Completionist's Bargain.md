Behind the door, hear a bunch of goblin noises, and something whimpering

Satine kicks open the door and says something sassy
There's a couple of humanoids (bugbears), and a goblin that faints upon seeing us.

Satine chucks a spear at one, grazing its eyeball
Start combat
Felni bites a leg
Felni turns into a bear
Satine kills one
Felni hits the other
Kestrel hits with his lovely new magical sword - killing it!

Loot: eyepatch with semi-precious stones, 33sp
Osmo also takes a pair of fangs and the ears from each
Satine picks up a tasteful nude of a Bugbear lady from under the bed, and puts it into her pocket
Felni picks up 2GP from under the bed

Satine kicks the goblin awake
Goblin: My name is Droop, I'll show you secrets!

He leads us back to the hidden corridor, removes a brick, and unlocks it with a key he took from the bugbear
Its a short corridor, leading to another locked door, which he also opens.
Order: Droop, Felni (as a bear), Kestrel, Satine, Osmo

Enter into a room with a writing desk and a bed. A glass staff leans against his chair, and he sits there reading a large tome.
Satine: I am Satine, who are you.
Glassstaff: Hello there. My name is Iarno, though some Glass-staff.

We ask after the goatskin - 1k gp
We ask after gundren, he tries fleeing, then we're all grappling for the staff.
We finally stop him, clap a mage hand over his mouth, get him to calm down
Promise to protect him from the Black Spider in exchange for information - we're gonna put him in prison
BS is in Cragmaw Castle with Gundren
Another brother somewhere else.
BS is a drow with an army of bugbears.

We loot the room
Kestrel has the goatskin
180SP, 130GP, silk pouch with 5 carnelians (5GP each), 2 peridots (15GP each), 1 pearl (100GP).
Scroll of Charm Person, and a Scroll of Fireball.
Glass Staff (+1AC, 10 charges to cast: Mage Armor (1), Shield (2), regain 1d6+4 charges every dawn, if expend last charge, roll d20 and destroyed on a 1)

> [!NOTE] A letter with a black spider symbol
> Lord Albrek, 
> My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don’t allow them to upset our plans. See that any dwarven maps in their possession are delivered to me with haste. I’m counting on you, Iarno. Don’t disappoint me.

Walk through another door to a wizarding / alchemical workshop.
	Set up to brew Potions of Invisibility.
Bookshelves are covered in sheaves of parchment and tomes.

> [!NOTE] Book: Lost Mine of Phandelver and the Forge of Spells
> A magic mace named 'Lightbringer' was commissioned by Llathander (God of Dawn) - lost when the cave and mine vanished from history.

Investigate the rest of the Manor
There's a room with two human warriors gambling.
Kestrel: It's time to look for alternate forms of employment.
Guys: You can't just fire us like that!
Kestrel raises his flaming sword.
They try to take the loot on the table and run away.
Kestrel: Eh eh lads.

Take money from the table (coins covering the 45th and 46th rulers of neverwinter)

We walk into the armory
Felni takes a spear
No-one else is really interested lmao.

We head out to go put Albrek in jail.
Sildar comes out: Albrek? Why is he in chains?
We explain, and he accompanies us to put Glassstaff in jail
Gives us 50GP each as thanks for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

---

Head over to Barthen's
Osmo: It costs 1k now, according to fair market price.
Barthen: No? This is my goat?
Satine: We went through more than expected, and think you should compensate your business partners.

The 44th ruler is a very large dragonborn, so the gold pieces were called pounds.

We give him the goathide, he gives us 50GP each.
Also a future 10% off on all future purchases.

As we leave, we notice a priest kneeling next to a small shrine of stones, praying loudly to Tymora to aid the weak, poor, oppressed, and wishing for the Redbrands to be banished from the area.

Satine: The group who have disbanded the Redbrands in the name in Sune!
Priest: My god Tymora, she works in such mysterious ways.
Priest: My clergy have given me a delicate mission, and you may be able to help! Out in the forest there lives a banshee called Agatha. I wish for an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift - this silver comb - to tell you what she knows of a legendary spellbook belonging to a mage named Bowgentle. 
Garaele: Someone who flatters Agatha's vanity might be able to trade the comb for the answer.
Garaele: I've been asked to get it for the clergy. They get delivered by snails. Train snails.
Garaele: Agatha is near Coneberry, it was sacked by barbarians years ago, the Triboar trail goes straight through it
Garaele: x5 potions of healing if we return with the info
