</div></div>


We had gone off to bed, waking up the next morning all refreshed.
In the morning, Satine shows off the bounty she took from the Mayor's
> Orcs near Wyvern Tor
> 100 GP overall

Osmo asks after the location - gets it marked on the map
We agree to go to Conyberry first, then to Wyvern Tor (its on the way)

There's a light rain outside, making the air damp
We hear a young halfling boy yelling out 'Geralt! Geralt!' carrying a book in his hand.
Boy: Sign my book, please!
Boy: I heard you killed _all_ the Redbrands!

The book is the Witcher, Sands of Destiny.
Kestrel: Who am I signing this to?
Boy: My name is Carp! You're my favourite hero!

Kestrel: You should read more books.
Carp: I told my Mummy that you were in town and she said no you're just a book character, but I showed her a picture I drew of you (its a picture of Kestrel sleeping).
Kestrel signs it 'To Carp, Don't come into my room while I'm sleeping, now go be a hero'.

Osmo: Is this a common occurence, _Geralt?_
Kestrel: There's an urban myth - Geralt is the Mario of witchers.

---

We head off, stopping around lunch.
Osmo splits a sending stone between Satine and Kestrel
Also shows off the Bag of Holding

That night, we set up camp under a small corpse of trees.
Osmo talks about one day creating a dome, then maybe even a mansion.
Watch schedule: Satine, Felni, Kestrel, Osmo

Satine can hear vague noises from the trees nearby.
Can see seven creatures flying towards her - stirges
Satine wakes everyone - kicking Kestrel and Osmo awake

A stirge lands on Satine's back
She suplexes it into the ground

Osmo sends off three magic missiles to three stirges
Satine kills one
Kestrel misses one
Felni turns into a giant frog and eats one.

---

Morning comes by, the weather is a little frosty but with a nice breeze.
We start to see Conyberry in the distance - all in ruins, doesn't even look like we could spend the night here.

Have a convo about whether Satine's followers are cultists
Kestrel: I can kill many things. Student debt is not one of them.

We head down into Conyberry - despite Osmo's reluctance about going so late at night.
We find the house, and Satine walks in, unpinning a little bit of her hair.
The rest of us follow her.

The air grows cold, and a dread grips at us.
A figure of a woman appears in the air.
Banshee: Foolish mortals, don't you know it's death to seek me out?
Satine: We're just here for some information.
Satine hands over the silver comb.
Agatha: I know you seek many things - ask me one question and I will give you one answer.
Osmo: What information do you have of the legendary spellbook belonging to a mage named Bowgentle?
Agatha: You spoke to that sister - she came a couple of days ago asking the same question
A: I had the book, and I traded it to a necromancer Tsernoth in the city of Iriaebor, more than a hundred years ago.

We leave her place, and start walking through the hills.
As we crest the ridge, we see the walls of a crumbling ruin, with a stump of an old tower. There is a colourful tent set up in the middle of the courtyard.

Osmo goes to look - through their owl form
Can smell death, as we get closer
There is a light on in the tent - no shadows moving against the candlelight, but can hear some snoring.
Satine can sense 12 undead beings within 60ft - clustered within the watchtower
The owl sneaks into the tent - sees a cot with a man in it, comfortable traveling suitcase, chest, writing supplies on a desk.
The man is wearing red robes, with a shaved scalp - a red wizard of Thay.

We murder him before he wakes up.

Osmo searches the entire tent, looking for spellstuff.
In the travelling chest - 55SP, 75GP(10th ruler of Neverwinter), 1 pearl (worth 100GP)
x1 potion of healing, spell scroll of darkness in a bone tube, tiny jeweled box (25gp), ring of protection (v ancient)
on the writing desk - pieces of paper detailing all his discoveries he's made in the area - about the ring he's found and that it's from netheril era, talks about agatha, about the historical questions he wanted to ask her, an about a well with an owl atop it (a local source of fresh water)

We all exit the tent, heading towards the tower
looks to be a holding cell for the zombies
