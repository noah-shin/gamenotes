Meet in a pub
becky - Nefertari (Captain) (Naharan) hiring sailors for a trip
Tudor ApPaul - old guy, asthma, navigator
liz - Eman - medicine? looking for aid for her city?
jess - Dewydd - escaping
Paul ApTudor - big ole sword guy
Rhiana - drunk woman

Head into the rivers beneath the caves, singing sea shanties
As we get deeper, hear an echo that joins in, before fading
	There's an old folk tales of selkies, and a haunting voice that echoes along with your own
	Rumours that they're actually the same as sirens

Parking for the night
Come across an abandoned boat in their usual spot
There's an abandoned plate of food, a knife on the floor, slime marks across the floor, piece of thin rubber sitting in a slime spot

Dewydd hops aboard
Picks the lock to the cabin - a heavy steel door - revealing smashed empty crates, a boot facing away from the door on its side (inside is a foot - looks like it was chewed off, freshly eaten)
Picks up the rubber - realises its a piece of skin, like seal skin

We move on, continuing singing
Can hear background singers, even as we trail off
Haste immediately covers their ears
A few others follow - a couple don't
The Captain gets a nat 1, Eman has a 2
Nef thinks we need to slow the lift down to avoid traps, Eman starts trying to push Paul into the water
Paul, Haste, and Dewydd block their ears

Finally get fabric into everyone's ears to plug them
The singing goes silent
A third of the boat goes up the lift
There's suddenly a sharp scream, that's joined by multiple others
In the cave entrance, from behind, there's torches flickering, and the sound of footsteps on the water
They look human, but their bodies rotting, the skin peeling from their faces

Combat

As we speed up the lift, we see more coming from the entrance
At their front is an older lady (same rotting bodies) from whom the cries came from
Nef can tell that they weren't undead

We head over the top, passing a bunch of broken open crates
Continue on till late
Moor up, head to bed, Nef and Dewydd taking the first watch
