Head out of the cave
Greeted by the almost optimistic visage of Captain Torr
Told to go through to the Baron for another job and for our credits

Head through
In chair behind desk, the receptionist - Hera - a buff space mom, long wavy white-blonde hair with pink tips and silver jewellery weaved through, floral and pink tattoos on her face and across her body, plain blindfold over her eyes

---

down the hallway comes a heavily armoured stormtrooper, escorts us into the throne room/office/dining room
behind baron nevis is a bodyguard - Cade - a mandalorian in full armour (white and gold), jetpack, all the bits and bots

Baron to Cade - how do you eat?

have a chat
he doesn't have credits - there's no exporting rn cause the leaving codes aren't working
asked to go retrieve them - instead of asking the Moff

will also get 5k credits, a couple of artifacts, and free repairs

half a day a way, city of Yrgetta (?) is an Imperial communications outpost
contains updated set of codes

we agree
hera, i, and lya head out

baron to cade - i appreciate your work, but please understand, this cannot trace back to me. i will need you to clean it, and you'll be fully compensated, for everything.

---

Lya heads back to the Forgotten Fate
Meets 0020
she tries to hard reset, but nothing happens
she turns him off
and _shoots_ him dead
then puts him a metal box and burns him

---

grab rations and rope

---

lya enters the bedroom, once shared
locks away the shatter pistols - one used to kill el, the other binding them, the other is el's
then finds the holocron under the pillow - slightly open

comms kion
hera and cade overhear the conference - only in reference to 'an object looking different' that may have impacted the third party member, and is dangerous

---

kion heads over
the two fail at stealthing behind
lya keeps them both outside whilst she goes to the bedroom
cade and lya start compared and infodumping about their massive arsenal of weapons

fails at striking it with the saber - almost more pushback
puts it in a pouch, in a leadlined box, wrapped up, in the bottom of the pack

emerges, and we all head to the shuttle

---

city is preprogrammed in
the shuttle auto-drives out

run introductions
kion, bounty hunter and merc
cade from clan cadeera, bounty hunter (kion recognises the name)
> during clone wars, the clan was unaligned with other mandalorians, operating as a small mercenary troop

hera, aspiring jizzist
Lya lorlavette, bounty hunter

cade's worked with a bunch of famous bounty hunters - boba fett, cad bane, crimson dawn, etc
has heard the name **Thane** before (Lya's ex)

---

rest for the night
cade goes to sleep

hera - so what do you know of the force?
kion levitates a kyber crystal out of her inner pocket, showing it, then tucks it back away
kion - why do you want to know?
hera - there's so much force energy around you two

she pulls down her blindfold, revealing vestigial sockets
kion recognises her as miralun (?), who are blind and percieve fully through the force
kion tells her that she's a jedi

asks us to keep the force shit to a minimum

---

two peaceful watches
cade dreams - dreams of home
> back at Mandalore, stood there amongst a field of dead, beskar laying beside you, two figures rushing forward in white and gold, one with a green lightsaber, blaster in hand, second has two pistols, both in full beskar, rushing towards a stampede of imperial droids and bombers, in a night sky of tears

hera dreams - back in that throne room
> being presented like a prize, offered to darkness and dread, like an extra tool
> beside you, a disheveled but proud devornian
> to your right, an armoured figure, clad in black, breathing through mechanical remains
> a red saber bursts through the chest of the man who raised you

enter the city, far larger and busier
clear signs of the empire and its propaganda
kion wakes the group
hera throws a dagger at kion when she wakes

---

the city is made mostly of the muun, once part of the triad of evil
amongst the homeless and the tired, is a clone in ruined armour
kion hands over a couple credits

---

get to the station
distraction team (lya and cade) head in, arguing about bikini shapes
manage to keep it going for a while
end up attacking the droid and trooper at the door

back door crew (kion and hera) stealth in, walk through half the compound
