We receive a letter from Amancio - it contains a small painting of a woman, called the Lisa Mona, signed Da Vinki.
The letter reads 'The payee wants you to switch out the original for this copy. It is currently being displayed in one of the Orion mansion - there is a ball tonight to show it off.'
There's a different pen that reads 'I want my work back where it belongs, they are nothing but thieves. These haters of art won't even be able to tell the difference.'

Etienne asks her cousin's old school friend Patterina to introduce the Orion's eldest to them, as he has a bit of a gambling problem.
- Some of the city council, and some art snobs will be turning up.

Armand goes looking for the Orion mansion blueprints - within a book that he cannot take.
- Under the house is a network of service tunnels
- Leading to the basement, gardens, etc.
- One in the ballroom leads to the basement, then to the side of the house.
He draws a rough copy for Etienne when he returns.

Engagement roll: 5

10 guards outside - private security

Some of the guests: 'Benjamin has really pulled out all the stops for this party, ahhaha.'
The painting is at the back wall, between the pair of stairs leading up.

We meet:
- Gerald Luvieres (owns the taxi company)

We overhear:
- Benjamin Jr has a gambling problem
- At the last ball, Benjamin Jr lost money on his father's birthday - bet the family house and nearly lost it. Lost it to one of the Buttons.
- The last ball was but a fornight ago - Benajmin Sr turned 80.
- There's a new species of Leviathan, their blood in the cigarettes seems to help.
- They bought the painting in an auction
- The painter wasn't able to pay his taxes, the baliffs took it all.
- Gerald sniffs crack.
- Orion's are a long-line of whalers.

Etienne heads to the quiet corridor to overhear any conversations
Spots a cart with a glass frame - how the transport the painting over.
Opens one of the doors - staff locker room, with a servants entrance to the outdoors.
One wall of lockers don't have names, and are infront of where the door to the safe room was in the blueprints.

Arman goes to find Ben Sr.
Ben Sr lights a cigar with the top of his cane - it looks like a blue plasma ball (matches the lighting in the rest of the room - the electroplasm of this world)
The painting was a betting war between Ben Orion and Cayde Button
He spent 10 COIN on it, and doesn't even like it that much
Primary motive was to spite Cayde.
When not on display it is in the vault - they use the same safe as us, and got it hidden.
Cayde's cousin - Jacob - fell into a canal a few days ago.

We state that Etienne is actually an art authenticator.
Studied it for her father - the Chancellor Gold.

We split up to convince the members of the party that this version is a fake, and that Cayde has the original.
Fairly successful, even manage to convince one man that he came up with the idea.

Etienne spots a servant wearing a gold sash - the Head of Staff
He has a keyring on his belt, one is clearly for the safe.

Ben Orion slowly makes his way down the steps - he so rarely engages with a party like this, and draws eyes
Ben: Hello there my friends. You may have heard a bit of a rumour going around this evening about the painting not being real.
Armand points out the man he had talked to earlier - Reverend Johnson - and blames him for the rumour.
Orion motions to the Head of Staff, who takes the Reverend down the corridor.
Ben asks Etienne to authenticate the piece.

Etienne: I am an expert on Da Vinki, and his seven wives. The painting is of Lisa Mona, his third wife.
Etienne: I would be happy to authenticate, though I will need somewhere a little more private, and a microscope, a UV light, rock salt and some sea water.

Orion taps his cane at the front to get everyone's attention, it making a large noise.
Orion: Friends, close enemies. I am now going to retire the Lisa Mona for security reasons, we don't leave it out for too long. Please step away from the painting, and we will return to the festivities in a moment.

The servants step forward, cover the painting, and put it into the cart.
We are motioned to follow, and do so.
They take us, not to the Vault, but further down.
We pass one door and can overhear knuckles hitting flesh.
They take us into a darkroom (like for photography), and place the painting onto a table.
One servant closes the door and blocks the entrance.

Armand stumbles and asks the servant - Jonathan - to go get a chair for him
He does, and the pair quickly swap the painting out, though the painting is not perfectly replaced.
The two servants arrive - one bearing the items, the other carrying the chair.
Jonathan wedges the chair underneath the doorknob - keeping the door open.
Armand: ???
Jonathan tries to yank the chair out, breaking the doorknob.

Etienne gasps, and asks for Mr Orion
E: You did in fact purchase the original, but it was tampered with, see the glue is still tacky - its been done within the past 48 hours.

He asks us to keep our silence, and we head home.
