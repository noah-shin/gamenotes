### Song-berries
Unique to Glimmerwood, these special berries can be found by listening for the singing fairies that flock to them. Good in jam and a staple of High Rannoc cakes.

### Smooth-Croak
These colourful frogs are so unbelievably smooth that I had to put up signs reminding visitors not to stroke them. Sure, it makes your skin baby soft but it really hurts the frog. Use wet gloves for this one.

### Wild Roses
A beautiful plant that the people of High Rannoc have both tried to encourage and tried to stomp out. They grow where they can get sunlight, and are easy to find in Summer.

### Shadow Shark
Whenever this glowing eyed predator is injured it surrounds itself with a cloud of black ink that is nearly impossible to see through.

### Crow Coal
A favourite among corvids who have eaten something foul, Crow Coal is a silvery coal that neutralises most ingested poisons. Getting it from the crows that guard it isn’t easy.

### Surgeon Sap
A staple of the Nurse Willow, this sticky sap actively encourages the healing process. Wounded animals often lick it straight from the tree which is an option if in need.

### Hiker's Helper
A thick and leafy weed that grows wherever it can take root, which, thanks to hikers discarding the used leaves wherever they please, seems to be all over High Rannoc.

### Pillar Mushroom
These mushrooms can reach well over the height of a man if left unattended. That rarely happens because they’re delicious as well as medicinal.

### Badger Phlegm
These small black insects are spherical, but most people never see one. They create a thick morass of green sticky slime around themselves that few predators bother to chew their way through.

### Foxsocks
These long white flowers with orange tops earn their name in how many people they fool into seeing a running fox in the fringes of their vision. Whilst pretty to look at, they smell closer to a dead fox than a flower.

### Albatross Dandelions
These dandelion seeds float twice round the world before finding their home and taking seed. Throughout this journey their potent healing abilities grow. Catching one requires standing on a tall hill at sunset with a net on a long pole.

### Skullcap
These morbid little mushrooms look almost exactly like shrunken human skulls. When they spore, the jaw breaks open and releases the cloud like a cough.
