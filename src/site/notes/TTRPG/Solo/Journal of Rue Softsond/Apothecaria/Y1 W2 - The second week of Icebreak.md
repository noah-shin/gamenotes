## Y1 W2 - Ailment
**Timer:** 6

Well, I didn't expect my prediction from last week to come true quite so quickly.

One of the *Zero Heroes*, a *Morgan Kip* turned up at my door, head ducked in shame. 
When he looked up to explain what he was doing, it made sense pretty quickly - his lips had bubbled up and green poison streaked under his skin.

He tried to pretend that he hadn't kissed a frog, but I've seen this before, and old Grandmother Heather's notebook agreed with me.

Well, I knew where half of the potion was going to come from pretty quickly - the Smooth-Croak for the warts - but I'd have to head back into the dungeons to grab some Skullcap for the Poison.

#### Dungeon

I decide to hit the dungeon first, seeing as I've been there so recently, and I still want to be looking for something new.

And something new is found indeed, for as I walked (as silently as possible, which is not very silent), I felt a bone snap underfoot, and the body it belonged to did complain. And complain. And complain.

I apologised, sliding the bones back together, and tried to engage them in some idle conversation.

Turns out, being dead is just really fucking boring. I promised to bring them some word games next time I was by.

**Timer:** 5
#### Loch

After I skedaddled out, I decided to visit the lake, get some needed sunshine in. The winter is still just breaking, and a walk along the beach would do me good.

Along the way, I near broke a toe, stubbing it on some metal canisters half-buried in the sand. The label on them had long since washed away, but I wasn't about to just open them, nor leave them there.

With a huff, I tucked them into my bag with the Smooth-Croak mucus, and made my way back home.

**Timer:** 4
#### Cottage

Once I got back, it was easy enough to whip up the [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/4.1 Ailments - Novice#Potion of a Prince's Kiss\|4.1 Ailments - Novice#Potion of a Prince's Kiss]] for Morgan to rub against his lips and gums.

## Y1 W2 - Downtime
**Timer:** 6 + 4

I decided to spend some more time with Sleet for the rest of the week, cleaning the house and moving all the furniture around.

One day, during my morning walk, Sleet bounced off, as they are wont to do.
After a while, I heard their voice calling me towards the edge of the town, towards a small manor with a garden that disappeared into the forest.

I walked up, aiming to introduce myself as the new witch in town, when *Fern Wagon* trotted down the steps and introduced herself to me. She's the Shelter Owner, and very quickly managed to get me inside and seated amongst the various animals and sheets of paper that detailed her work.

It was kind of startling, because she didn't feel very rushed, nor full of energy. I would've called her sedate, if not for the fact that I blinked and something new was happening every time.

For the rest of the day, I decided to explore the Shelter, to see how it operated, and what I could do to help. I helped clean, got to know the various familiars and their names, and answered the door to *Fairweather*, who bore a parcel for *Peaches the Rat*. 

I helped Fern unwrap it, a gorgeously soft pillow that Peaches could spread out on - a gift from a witch-in-training in Reilon.
