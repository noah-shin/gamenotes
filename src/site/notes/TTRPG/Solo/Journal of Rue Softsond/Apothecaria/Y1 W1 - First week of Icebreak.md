A quick chat with the local Chief - [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Lola Green\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Lola Green]] - and I was showed to the old witch's cottage. She's left a couple of notes around the place, a spare Alembic in the cupboard for which I am very grateful for (mine broke a month ago, in an unfortunate donkey related incident), and a single garden plot with an old *Surgeon Sap* growing.

**Turns**: 13
**Timer**: 6

In those first days of spring, I had a few days of peace, of settling the cottage to my preference, before I got my first knock at the door.

To my surprise, [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Jinah Stonewater\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Jinah Stonewater]] stood at my door, a fish-hook caught through the webbing of her finger and thumb. She smiled grimly at me, explained that she had seen in a shadow in the water of the loch that had so startled her that she had managed to net a huge catch - herself.

I immediately knew I could use the [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/3. Reagents#Surgeon Sap\|3. Reagents#Surgeon Sap]] in the garden to deal with the wound itself, and the Shadow Shark Ink for the pain, but Jinah could wait the day for me to visit the farms around the town to collect some [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/3. Reagents#Hiker's Helper\|3. Reagents#Hiker's Helper]].

When I arrived, I came across a loud adventuring party - the [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Zero Heroes\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Zero Heroes]], who were planning to head into Hero's Hollow. Next time I go that way, I'll have to help them out.

I left the crowded town center, passing by [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/2. Locations in Baesham#The Copper Fox\|2. Locations in Baesham#The Copper Fox]], who had the most *excellent* bard performing infront of it. I left 2 silver, and listened as he seemed to tell a story of old witch Heather - I'll have to ask him how true it was the next time I visit.

Oh, of course, it was *Khiom!*

Once I reached the start of the hiking paths, a postal harpy - *Fairweather* came by and dropped a small parcel in my arms. It was from [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Kiel Minuet\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Kiel Minuet]], an old friend and fellow witch-in-training I befriended back in Innes, before they went to Lowham to become their resident witch.

They'd sent me an interesting book on the history of the mythological beasts of the area, a second edition with interesting notes in the margins in their handwriting.

I packed it into my bag with a bundle of Hiker's Help, and quickly made my way back to the cottage before the evening meal.

I was able to cook up the [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/4.1 Ailments - Novice#Minor Potion of Healing\|4.1 Ailments - Novice#Minor Potion of Healing]] rather quickly, and had Jinah feeling better by the time we finished our meal of soft bread and fried fish.

(Side effect: The potion was a little too cold on her skin, and I figured out that it's because the potion can also be used on Burns. Useful as a catch-all, but perhaps a little too broad.)

#  Downtime
**Timer**: 6

As I found myself without any work the following morning, I decided to join that adventuring troupe over in the Hero's Hollow.

Boy that was ... something. I ended up skipping a night of sleep to help them out, trying to find this mythical creature that everyone in the village - and the surrounding lands - knows is a children's tale.

Called the **[[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Boobooganugah\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Boobooganugah]]**, it's a cat sized creature characterised by its thick dark fur that absorbs magic very well, which can create the best invisibility cloaks.

It was fun to stretch my genuine magical ability, not needing to rely on reagents, but I soon discovered that they had made this trip a dozen times last year, and the year before that. The majority of the first day was spent walking around in the circles that they had traced the year before, whilst the night was spent making sure the lot didn't die from the cold, due to their lack of supplies.

A well meaning group, but I wouldn't be surprised to see one of their member pass through my cottage doors within the coming months.

**Timer**: 3

Whilst there, though, I figured I might and try to grab some of the reagents I hadn't seen yet. Ideally, I had my eyes set on some [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/3. Reagents#Crow Coal\|3. Reagents#Crow Coal]].

I made my way through the winding tunnels and avoiding the various tombs, following the crow droppings to see where they were guarding the silvery coal. I found them in a low shelf of a long-crumbled bookshelf in a ruined library, and took the moment to flick through some of the tomes.

It talked of the history of High Rannoc, of the ley lines of magic that ran thick and fast beneath the village.

The rest of the book had long turned to dust, or been ripped apart by the various things that nested here. But I just hummed, the crows having long since settled to my presence. With a gentle flick of my wrist, I gathered a few pieces of coal, tucked them into my belt, and figured that was enough adventuring for the week.
