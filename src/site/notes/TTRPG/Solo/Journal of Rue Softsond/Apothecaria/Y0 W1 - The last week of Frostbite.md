> **Location**: On the road to High Rannoc

High Rannoc has requested a new village witch, and I am on the way to fill that need. Ah well, I'm moving on now. New places, new people.

I met one this morning, [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Sierra Steep\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Sierra Steep]], the tanner who lives on the outskirts of High Rannoc. She came to me as I was having breakfast, as I was about to pack up and head into the town proper.

A trouble with warts, she said, unwrapping her scarf from her face.
I soothed her, as half a witch's job is just managing the people, and reassured her that she had caught it early - only a few on her nose, and nothing to be worried about at all.

It was an easy enough fix, though it would delay my entry into the village by a week as I would have to find the various ingredients, and learn the various areas.

First, I took a look at the local forest - **Glimmerwood Grove,** a beautiful name for a gorgeous and giving forest.

My first day there, I wandered through without harm or threat, and even found a patch of *Wild Roses* at the end of a track made by a wild board. I found the *Songberries* before nightfall, and even added some of the to my dinner for that hint of sweetness.

The following day, I made my way to **Meltwater Loch**, full of rumours and breath-taking views. 

I went out onto the waters, and soon crossed paths with [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/1. Personae Dramaticae#Jinah Stonewater\|1. Personae Dramaticae#Jinah Stonewater]], a lovely dwarf eager for conversation. She told me the best place to fish for *Shadow Shark*, and sure enough, I had caught one for my lunch, with enough ink to keep for later! It's not that sweet, but it's perfect with some chili and lemongrass.

In the evening, as I found a place off one of the secret beaches to rest, I found an odd set of footprints in the sand. They looked human, but sunk far deeper in the sand than any normal man, and had the faintest impression of webbing between the toes. Profoundly strange.

In any case, that morning, I found the colourful frogs, and donned my wet gloves to extract some mucus, and took care not to stroke their incredibly soft skin - it hurts the frogs and causes their mucus to dry up.

Before I returned to Sierra, I took an hour to create the [[TTRPG/Solo/Journal of Rue Softsond/Grimoire/4.1 Ailments - Novice#Potion of Soft Skin\|4.1 Ailments - Novice#Potion of Soft Skin]], and walked into High Rannoc 24 Silver richer and a Potion lighter.
