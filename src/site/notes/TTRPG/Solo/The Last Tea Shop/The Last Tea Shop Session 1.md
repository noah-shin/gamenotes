*You run a tea shop on the border of the living and the dead. The recently deceased visit for one last hot drink before their long journey into the Great Beyond.*

*Time is strange here. Days and memories blur. Nobody visited yesterdayâ€”you are sure of that. Someone passed last week, but you can't recall their face.*

*The fog thins. A figure approaches. You stoke the fire.*

----------

# The Teashop

*The shop is in a quiet place, often cloaked in mist or light rain. There is a special feeling here. Moments stretch and fade. This is a space for communion and release.*

A shelter in the centre of a meadow of **waist-high grass**, the shop is built on an outcropping of stone that has long-worn down into a flat platform.

When the weather is dry, I walk through the meadow and collect the fallen **star grass**, hanging some for the tea, bundling the rest for the thatched roof.

When a new visitor arrives, I offer the cards - do they wish for a reading or a game?

The pips on the cards are mirrors of the constellations above.

# The Lantern Path

*Once you knew many routes between the lands of the living and the dead. Nowadays, your memory is hazy and the knowledge has slipped away. You recall just two paths.*

### Four days pass.

The sky is covered in a sepia haze when a **tailor** arrives, carrying a gift, a bundle of **bright gumdrops** in his bag. His eyes are toned the same sepia, and his sigh carries the weight of **nostalgia**.

I start to brew the tea - a **Comforting Brew** - grinding the sea salt with the leaves. The air fills with the scent of the ocean spray, the summer heat, the morning mists.

As the water boils, I offer him the cards and ask about **his journey to the tea shop**. He opts to play a game, one he has long memorised. The cards leave glowing freckles on his fingertips as he talks.

He had reached glory by 30, and reached memory by 35. The rest of his life spent chasing that glory, trying to reclaim that memory. *He had trodden the paths of the past for so long that he had slipped away in a dream.*

The game finishes, but he has looped back around into his memory, into the blissful past, away from the hurt of the present.

I serve the tea, but he holds it like he's forgotten what the warmth is for.

I ask him what the **great lesson of this life** was, then, as the present loses its thorns in favour of comfort.

He blinks at me, clouded eyes behind wire-frame glasses. His tea reflects the stars, the sepia haze invisible in the reflection.

*Whatever it was, I did not learn it.* His eyes close as he begins to cry, tears heavy with salt and sand. *A lie is always easier to bear.*

When he leaves, his eyes are clear, but full of sorrow.

### Two days pass.

There is a soft indigo drizzle, leaving a faint glowing mist to twine between the grasses.

A shepherd arrives, his back straight, his shoulders tilted forward in curiosity despite a gentle sadness.

I start to brew the tea - a **Rainbow Medley** - melting the gumdrops on the stove. The air fills with the scent of sugar and brightness, despite the gloom.

As he sits, I offer him the cards and ask **what remains undone?** He opts to play a game, but chooses something solo, a game to pass the time without demanding focus. The cards leave glowing freckles on his chin when he taps them there in thought.

*My job. I left them defenceless on the hills. The river caught me, and I fear my flock will follow my fate.*

His voice is not heavy with guilt, just a melancholy for what his mistake has cost.

He continues to play, and I stir the molten sugar. I ask **how did you know the Tailor?**

His hands still, and he stares at the constellations infront of him. 

*He was my brother, and he went to the city to seek his dream. The pride we all felt when he achieved it - but he never did learn humility.*

I hum in response as I serve the tea, the room beginning to fill with bright lights and colours. I do not tell the shepherd everything, but I mention the set of his shoulders when he left, when he walked further down the lantern path. **What do you think lies beyond?**

The shepherd laughs, cupping a bright blue light in his hands. 

*Nothing. Everything. Perhaps I will become the flock, or perhaps I will become the river.*

### Five days pass.

The sky is clear, the meadow illuminated by gentle sunbeams.

A herbalist makes their way down the lantern path, her face **calm,** a small pouch of feather moss on her belt.

When I accept the gift, I ask her **what is the last thing you remember?**

She smiles, and shows the berry-dyed lines on her hands. *One plant looks much like another, even to the trained eye. I ate a berry, and now I will feed the forest that long sustained myself.*

She sounds almost fond, settling into her seat as I begin to steep the moss for some **Gumboot Tea**.

Once drenched, I offer her the cards, and ask **how did you know the Shepherd?**

She nods in familiarity at the description, and I begin to shuffle for a three-card spread.

*I saved his life once. He had come down with a fever - bitten by an insect that lived in the sheep's wool. For five days I fed him broth and burnt herbs, and eventually he woke, then stood, then was able to walk out.*

The cards presented are the same I draw for myself, every time. Death, the Star, Temperance. The constellations already glow alone her neck, her jaw, her cheek.

I shuffle them back into the deck, then serve the tea. I ask her **what did you hide?**

She takes a sip of tea before answering, letting the warmth settle her soul, letting her shoulders settle back to neutrality. 

*Something that will stay hidden.*

### Five days pass.

The night is heavy, and the swirling mists dance between the stars.

A cloaked figure holding a telescope approaches from a different path. They pull back their hood to greet me, revealing dark eyes filled with stars, eyebrows furrowed in confusion. Something strange clearly happened on their journey to the tea shop.

I welcome them in, shredding the star grass, and ask **what did you seek, and why?**

They set the telescope down, and hang up their cloak. *Secrets, so that I could understand. The knowledge will bring me peace, closure.*

I offer the cards, but they decline either, the constellations already burning bright within their eyes.

Without prompting, he answers *I seek the secret of the Herbalist. She was a colleague, then a lover, then a stranger. I looked up, drawing from the skies, and she looked down, drawing from the ground. One day, I asked her whether this distance was ever reconcilable, and she closed her lips around the answer.*

I pour the tea, heavy with the weight of starlight. They take a sip, and the heavenly wheel turns.

I ask **what did you stop believing in?**

They meet my gaze and I can see a revelation make itself known, the confusion fading.

*I did not need to be in the stars to study them. She did not need to be in the dirt to study it. We were fools.*

They stand, then bids me farewell. The mist clears and the sky darkens.

Constellations appear. With each step, Astronomer gains a little altitude as though climbing an invisible staircase. The steps soon fade, leaving only a patch of **star grass**, joining the meadow. 

### Three days pass.

I forage from the meadow, unable to find the boundary of that celestial staircase. The incredible, rendered mundane.

As I straighten, the clouds begin to draw low, the sunset tinging them red. A Diplomat walks down the Lantern Path, carrying an ornate box of **shaggy moss**, jaw tight with frustration.

As I accept the gift, the words of past niceties flowing between us like a play, I ask him **what are you proud of?**

He puffs up, and talks of his resume, of the people he met, the places he went to. *I was important, recognised. I had impact on others.*

I begin to shred the kawakawa leaf as I hum, listening. He talks, and asks questions, and listens. I offer him the cards, and we play a game of poker, that I narrowly win - he tugs on his ear when considering risk, and now the constellations spiral around the curve and lobe of it.

*I even talked to the stars - I drafted a message that we would want to give to the universe as a whole. I met the Astronomer who then sent it. Good folk, that lot, though curious.*

He stops only to take the first sip of the **Distance Tea**, and I press forward, asking **you sacrificed something - what did you give up?**

He huffs, and that frustration makes itself known again, defensive and taut.

*They blame me when things are not perfectly resolved - no matter than it would've been worse without my intervention, that I cannot work miracles.*

The memory is difficult, but the tea calms the edges of it, lets him swallow it. The sun begins to set, and the red begins to fade from the clouds.

*I sacrificed my time, my relationships, my future, my past, my energy, my comfort, my privacy. I worked great things, and I do not regret it, but my loyalty did not matter, and I passed on alone, in a room I could not afford to heat.*

He drains the cup, then stands, head bowed. He carries the righteous anger with him when he leaves.

### Five days pass.

Since the Diplomat left, the rain has been relentless. The ground underfoot is thick mud, and the stars rest out of sight.

Between one breath and the next, a person clad in a long grey veil arrives, dark with the rain, each exhale heavy with exhaustion.

I begin to wash the shaggy moss as they wipe their feet at the doorway, and ask **what's the last thing you remember?**

The veil twitches, like a flinch, before they answer. *Walking. I have been walking for as long as I can remember, between the grass and the dirt and the stars and the rain. I have always been walking.*

I offer the cards, and do a reading. The High Priestess, Temperance, and Judgement. I ask **how did you know the Diplomat?**

They shrug, and the veil shimmers like light across a lake. *I met him on the path here. I met them all, but I talked to none of them. For some reason, I knew them, and did not need to talk.*

I serve the tea, but they do not take it, unmoving behind the veil.

I ask **who will you miss?** and the person slumps, exhaustion carved into every line. *All of them. none of them. You, most of all.*

They stand, stumble, steady themself before I can reach over. They step out into the rain and I cannot help but ask **what happens next?**

They pause, then hold out a hand, tea stains in the fingerbeds. *It depends on what you do. The tea, and the path, and this shop, are all your to choose from.*
