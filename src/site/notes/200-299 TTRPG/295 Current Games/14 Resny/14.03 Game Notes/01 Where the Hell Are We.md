Aaravos – Molly – Vampire Assasin (tries hard to keep up appearances) Vasrak – Anna – Drow warlock – otherworldly appearance / looking for their patron Eva – Lauren – Rogue/Bard – hood and cowl Oesna – Shelby – druid air genasi – green cloak / gold lining / three gems in their wrist Blank – Noah – doll bard – medium sized porcelain w/ a haegum / locket and vial around their neck

Items V – large shield stretched over a rib cage (?) A – small burlap bag attached to belt E – longbow made of vocal chords O – small corked bottle filled w/ swirling darkness B – vial of red liquid

We come through the mists, escaping a previous adventure Approach a small collection of houses There's a guy whistling / shadowing figures in houses (wearing porcelain doll masks) Resny existed on the material plane w/ multiple past tragedies How long has it been snowing? Hunched tall thin limp, black stringy hair, unblinking – Mila – the guy whistling – the builder – The first place he built was in the Marketplace – voice loops, no knowledge of the outside world – (mind haziness?)

Lady pulls AVO into house w/ shadowy figures 'were you followed? Did HE see you?' – named Penny man 'you already took him, didn't you? We don't have anymore' Lost their son Ruben Both have voice loops (temporary time loss? or a script?)

Shuffling behind wall by the stairs They're both wearing the doll masks Penny 'what masks?' (unaware their wearing them?) E tries to message – staticy nothing in her head – E is frightened O tries to take the mask off – gets necrotic energy (sealed on? grown on?) grooves in the wall, like a small door contains a CHILD – 'my party, my friends, my mother, all of them. It killed them' – named Melton – sister Etta. – last saw them in the marketplace

A makes husband kill Penny O tries divination : Where are the missing kids? – in a dark place / in cages / under where we can't find them – divination weaker here? / info provided as dark disembodied voices – potentially a children's rhyme? — Melton doesn't know what those are Ask Melton good hiding spots – only knows those in and around the houses

Marketplace : M points at largest north shop – Soviv & Sons Doll Shoppe other shops : butcher / weaving mill / blacksmith / apocathery / candles / church

Whats in the church? Barrels outside the doll shop?

Well in center of market – figures & body parts face down in the water figure : goat skull mask / 4 horned goat head insignia in white thread on the cloack – speak w/ dead fails. (why? undead, or asked something in the past ten days?) – mask comes off w/out problem – detect magic : body (necromancy. many spells)

Barrels at the shop full of porcelain dolls (new) Doll shop – dust, nasty, some collapsed shelves. Can hear a soft sobbing from inside.
