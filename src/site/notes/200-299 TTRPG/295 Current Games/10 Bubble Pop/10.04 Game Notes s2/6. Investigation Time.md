Downtime

(lost the first page of notes lmao sos) (smthg about an assembly) (spooky vision) (nyx and ansel's downtime?)

Penny – spends it red threading connections between the people who died – x2 unconscious and x1 dead in the past two weeks — its sped up — cara and betti on same day (betty went missing the day before) —– they were together in the club —– Da was friends with Jackson (?)

-   dead people seem random-ish — not assigned to a group — top A ranks are dying — person dying coincides with paladins going missing
    
-   paladins going missing in a rotation? — every three weeks — random within the week
    
-   last taken 2 ½ weeks ago
    
-   no traces
    
-   along the same route — between the two underground connections
    
-   paladins don't have a family (renounced) (weakening connection to Helm)
    

Achlys – walks into VP Rand's office – convinces him to leave for a bit – finds the tournament itenirary — 1) dragon maze with riddles —– winner gets advs in the other tasks — 2) quiz — 3) battle between teams

-   teams from Darkpit are the Talons and us
-   from XXX – lightning coolers and stormbreaker – elemental magics
-   from XXX – chosen light and highfliers – celestial based
    
-   can find nothing from HM — rand seems to have all the power
    
-   hacks the comp — no name assigned to anything in 3 ½ years — Erun Crosshand —– cannot recall a matching face or even the name

-   nothing major coincided — other than turnover of teachers who retired — previous VP retired 5 years ago


Skylar – training telepathy and physical str — new and improved feat
