Ansel – Insight checks Glowing Alanis – gets a blast of 'unknowable something', 11 dmg, goes DOWN AGAIN – their eyes gow slightly midnight blue before they get blown back and go unconscious Taylor – Arcana checks – becomes full of fear, unable to say anything Nyx uses Healing Potion, Ansel is back up

Ansel tries hold person, blue cage that fits around their skin, before gold light cracks and breaks through it Nyx tries tentacle grab Ansel tries Calm Emotions – success but does nothing?

Running – An can see electric blue along where Al is going Al dissapears in front of a door An draws on a sword on Zane – 'do you know where [Al] went?' – intimidation check fails, they just died like five times in a row – Zane ' we got you many pretty swords. we didn't have to'

Lockpick through Room of hospital beds/morgue slabs – lightning marks on the wall – bracelet stuck in a drain w/ 'Kelly' engraved – One grate, bloody — YOBI LICKS IT — tastes a bit of poison? very stale

Al is currently a passenger in their own body Voice in their head 'we'll get him this time. No second chances for Zanaxis' Al – 'let's get him' – has Magic Sight, 3 legendary resistances, +6 to all skills. SS DC 21, SA +13

drain passage more recent than the drain itself

Zanaxis is on the phone, texting, unaware of my presence – Failed Phantasmal Force, success Dissonant Whispers – Znx lightning dmg Al

Laura's daggers are An's first forgeries

Phantasmal Force again – success – Al turns into Lando and starts pressing down on Znx's laranyx with a fist (as though his hands are burnt through, lightning marks down them) – He gives a frustrated hurt desperate wail — “If you accepted the offer, you would still be here. We'd be ruling this together” – Al slices their throat with a card — Q of Spades – Tolld the Dead — “You dissapoint me” — Now coated in blood, still glowing Zane had – quaterstaff (jet black), arcane focus (necklace set in gold)

Taylor – “can we have Al back?” – Al shakes their head – Taylor shocked at a voice only they can hear – “No. I am protecting them. You can't keep them safe so I will.”

Yobi – Detect Thoughts – surface thoughts are like static – deeper is about Lady Luck

Taylor on the phone with Damien – “Al's patron has taken over to protect Al from mental/physical something” We make it back to the morgue Lei starts to appear Lei tackle hugs Al An plays Careless Whisper

Laura doesn't want to be near An Zane has a bonedeep exhaustion Al approaches Laura – “They didn't mean to –. They're sorry. But don't hurt them (threatening).” – Al also gives her a healing potion for Zane – Laura ? partially forgives them ?

First watch: Lei kisses Al Al regains control

Second watch: An to Laura – “I'm still a bit scared of you.” A – “Where have you been for the last year?” – “There was a job, went to shit, got detained, said nothing, went to a secret detainment funnel camp, escaped, then a day later we got caught by the cult.” A – “What was the job? No, I don't want to know” – “We were detained and escaped with Luke” – Luke hasn't contaced An A – “Have you heard anything about an execution?” – “No?!?!?!???” A – “I was looking into it, got a message a while ago from two guys mentioning it.”

Third watch: Yobi realises he actually likes this group. Fuck.

Noise along the tracks – group of 8 people walking towards Middlesborough – not average citizens – they wear insignias on their arms, holding weapons – one person (leader) has a different symbol Yobi wakes An – an recognises it – Seen on banners of antimutants – used in the actual war and not in smaller cults

Soldier – “I don't know why he (leader) wanted to skip that place to come here – it doesn't have that much importance, why aren't we sticking to the original plan?”

An wakes Taylor – who nearly stabs them with knife hidden under the pillow – An – oh shit that's attractive

Taylor checks the group – phones HMWM We finish sleeping – will head them off Laura and Zane are tired, Z has a phone. They'll seperate and find info on Luke.
