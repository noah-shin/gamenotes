(( walking through a stopped train on Bracca, Ozzy looks around ))

On the bridge, Savi stands with her helmet at her side.
- KO gives Kaz a hug (Ey stares)
- follows him to a side office

we are near Mygeeto
- something going on in the southern region
we chat, catch up
- he asks us to check out the planet, something seems wrong there
ey caught eavesdropping outside

ey wants to learn to fly
- goes to talk to a male Zeltron - Tim Cross, Kaverick
- learns in a Z95 headhunter

el trying to butter up Ret, asking for droid parts
- heads to scap room (his room lmao), finds deactivated mouse droid
- awkward convo is had

el fizes 0020 up, putting him on the mouse droid

ko - kav shows image of him and wife and daughter - saranrae and vasael
- 'when the Inquistors come, you can't do much'

we all meet infront of the arc fighter
- the call to the planet has dulled a bit over the past few hours
- ko finally finds out about 0020
- el and ko can feel general tug from south of planet, ey has something a bit more specific

strong winds, we are heading away from civilisation
- we land, rough
- have a quick chat about 0020
- head off to a snow covered mountain
-- el leading through the force

reach base of mountain
- there's a perfect circle at the base with a slightly ajar door
- two skeletons kneeling by ice pillars
- ko kneels between them, tells the twins to follow the force
ice wall parts

el going in, expansive room with ornate chair at end
- been here/ yet to go here
- next to chair is fully repaired 002
- an older el sat on the chair, angry and bored
- ey, broken and disheveled, making her way towards the back of the chair, in binds
- el (normal) has a key in hand. 
- el touches the chair, then unlocks ellya

ey heads down, finds herself a little shorter
- hallway of her family home, a purposeful walk towards the exit
- hears a 'im almost there, just wait a little longer'
-- from a shapeless figure to left
- hears 'not so fast lil gunslinger'
-- freedo 10ft away to right
- behind is el, same younger age, unaware of any of ellya's attempts to leave
have to choose whether they would redo the past to get here.
walks forward

twins emerge from their visions, holding hands
- in their grasp, as they part, are two kyber crystals
-- orange and indigo
