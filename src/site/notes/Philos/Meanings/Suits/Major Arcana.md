The Major Arcana consists of 22 trump cards, going from the Fool to the World. 

Individually, they generally signify life lessons, a point on one’s spiritual and emotional journey, and recurring themes in our collective experiences. 
Together, the Major Arcana is a cycle. We go from the Fool to the World, and back to the Fool again. 

Such is the nature of learning, growing and expanding.

If the [[Minor Arcana\|Minor Arcana]] speaks to our daily lives and the struggles we face achieving our various goals or coping with our problems, the Major Arcana- the trump cards- are like the constellations in the sky, or the gods and goddesses that fill the pantheons of the world. 

Like the cycle of a myth, the Major Arcana takes us on a journey that has no true beginning or end, told through the eyes of the Fool.

### The Fool's Journey

Since the Major Arcana reflects the soul’s journey from innocence to completion and fulfilment, of humanity's spiritual evolution into enlightenment and individuation, they can together be known as the Fool’s Journey. The order of the cards reflects each step of that journey. 

The journey is both individual and collective.

In our daily lives, it is also cyclical and infinite; we are always on that journey, and it would be a mistake of hubris and perhaps a tragedy to believe that as humans, we can find perfect closure and completion. 

Life, which we are a part of, is always changing and flowing, and we are too. This is not a flaw, but rather in our nature, and one that we must accept.
