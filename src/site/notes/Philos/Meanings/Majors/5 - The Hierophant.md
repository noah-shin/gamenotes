# Workbook

First Impressions: **Neutral**

It is a card at rest - and so at peace, of the gathering of oneself and of wisdom before embarking on a journey.
Not a card of movement or joy, with risk of stagnation, but ultimately one without conflict.

**If the Hierophant could speak, what advice would they have for you?**

What I need, in order to prepare for the journey ahead.
Listen and learn before leaping.

**Think back to a teacher that made a big impact on you. What made them inspiring?**

How their lessons related to our real lives.

**How do you feel about social structures? Do you find them comforting or smothering?**

I strive to build something that can feel as solid.

## Astrology

**How important is safety and reliability for you? 
When do you know to take a path that is tried and true versus take a risk and explore the unknown?**

Safety is a tool and consideration. It depends on the value of the end-goal as to how valuable it is in that moment.
