**An oracle deck that centers on the cycle of sowing and harvest, exploring themes of productivity and rest.**

The cycle of sowing and harvest is one that we see reflected around us every day . . . there are times for productivity and there are times for rest. The Seed and the Sickle Oracle deck is designed to encourage reflection on both. Each card carries two meanings; one for times when moving forward is important, and one to help cultivate your own well-being. Whether you are sowing seeds for your next big project or harvesting rewards for a period of rest, The Seed and the Sickle will accompany you on this journey.
