## Recipe

1) Preheat oven to 160°C

2) In a small pot over medium heat, whisk together the butter, cream cheese, and milk until melted and smooth. 
> You can also combine them at room temperature if all are sufficiently soft.
> Optional ingredients: Sugar (to taste, ~1/4 cup), lemon juice (~1 tbsp), vanilla extract (3 drops).

3) Remove from the heat and let cool.
> This is so the egg yolks don't cook.

4) In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks until smooth, then slowly drizzle in the cream cheese mixture, stirring until evenly combined.

5) Sift in the flour and the corn-starch, whisking to make sure there are no lumps.
> If the batter isn't smooth, strain it using a sieve.

6) In another large bowl, beat the egg whites with a hand mixer until soft peaks form. Gradually add the sugar while continuing to beat until stiff peaks form.
> Optional ingredients: Cream of tartar (~1/4 tsp) or lemon juice (~1/2 tsp)

7) Fold about ¼ of the egg whites and into the yolk mixture, then repeat with the remaining egg whites until the batter is evenly combined.

8) Grease the bottom of a 9 x 3-inch (23 x 7.5 cm) round cake pan, then line the bottom and sides with parchment paper. If using a springform pan, make sure to wrap the bottom and sides completely in foil twice to prevent any leakage.
> Make sure that the paper extends > 2 inches above the pan, but less than 5. The cake will rise a lot, but you don't want to stop the top from browning.

9) Pour the batter into the pan and shake to release any large air bubbles.
> For fun, you can gently drop the pan onto the counter instead.

10) Place the pan into a larger baking dish lined with 2 paper towels at the bottom. The paper towels ensure that the heat is distributed evenly along the bottom of the pan. Fill the larger pan about 1-inch (2-cm) high with hot water.
> As the cake cooks for longer than normal, the water is crucial to keep the cake moist.

11) Bake for 25 minutes, then reduce the heat to 285°F (140°C), and bake for another 55 minutes, until the cake has risen to almost double its original height.
> If the cake cracks on top, the heat is too high, or the cake is too close to the heating element. Keep in mind for next time.

12) Once cooked, turn off the oven, open the door a couple of inches, and let it cool to room temperature.
> The cake will deflate a little when cooling. The slow reduction in heat will help.
> If planning on eating the whole cake now, you can also serve hot!

13) Remove the cake from the pan, and refrigerate for 4 hours.
> The cold will set the cream cheese and increases the flavour and texture of the cake.

14) Eat within the week!
> Or freeze for up to 3 months, or eat then, I'm not your boss.
