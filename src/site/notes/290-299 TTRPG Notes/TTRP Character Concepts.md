Somnus : Tiefling | Paladin
Turns up like a bad penny

Hunt : Warforged | Gunslinger
Bounty-hunter AI who's broken free of their shackles and now dispenses their own sherrif-like justice

Ea Naient : Half-elf | Warlock
A priest by trade but warlock by curse, they turned to religion to quell the magic that battles inside them

Rani : Gnome | Ranger
A monster hunter who's entire team died, leaving them broken and uncertain if they should search for justice

Light : Fallen Aasimar | 
A leader of a cult, a failed messiah

Strike : Kalashatar | Blood-hunter
Motives split between the quorum of their blood and the need to become a monster to defeat the monsters, turning to blood-magic and battling to not succumb to the evil they use

Logarhythmn Picktionary : Halfling | ~~Rogue/Artificer~~ Wizard
They're 100% a wizard and it's not just clever tricks not at all they really are doing magic, they swear.

Lexicon : Veldaken | Wizard
I made it for the aesthetic

Echo : Changeling | Sorcerer
They have no control over their own sense of identity, magic and face a fluid and unknown thing

Jack : Half-elf | 
Scholar. Jack-of-all-trades.

Wick Ghallanda III : Hospitality Halfling | Artificer
Aesthetic again, bread and brass

Ashford : Tiefling | Rogue
Acrobat

Elarim Maseth : Half-orc | Monk
Exiled from their temple

Atala Artis : Half-elf | Bard
Ex-noble

Retta Whitehelm : Water Genasi | Barbarian
Sailor

Iadeis Kao : Tiefling | 
Soldier

Jem : Satyr | Druid
Shepard

Ku : Yewheart | Druid
It's the aesthetic for me

Ferros : Warforged | Cleric of the Forge

Morty : Ghost | Cleric of the Grave
Mortician by trade

Mori : Aasimar | Cleric of Life
Searching to become immortal, though doesn't want to become a lich, aims to control life and death

Lichtenberg : Triton | Cleric of Tempests
Pirate

Fork : Kobold (UA) | Drakewarden Ranger

Parry : Air Genasi | Barbarian (Ancestral Guardian)
CRIMINAL / PIRATE
reflavoured rage as focus. Basically he wasn't taking half damage because he was so pissed off at the world that getting stabbed just made him angrier, but instead was able to see the attack coming and even if he couldn't get out of the way entirely, he could dodge it enough to make it a glancing blow; effectively it was just heightened danger sense.

Nike : Half-elf | Barbarian (Zealot) / Rogue (Inquisitive)
Acolyte and follower of the Raven Queen. I really love the idea of a true fanatical follower of a god. Just go 3 levels into zealot barb and the rest into inquisitive rouge and bam. You can be routing out heretics and destroying blasphemers with ease.
