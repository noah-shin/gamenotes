Beyond the Veil:
70 - ~~Nat 20~~ / 5

We begin fighting off all the Fallen approaching the doors
Betty orders Amir back inside to begin the evacuation process

Arthur doesn't have his sword (cause he's drunk) and throws a mug of ale at the eliksni instead

Arthur gets hit by the walker and disintegrates

Roberto is still alive - Vix kicked him in the head jumping off the wall, and took some of the walker shrapnel

Vix casts an explosion of void light - eyes and necklace glowing a pure green  (an enchanting music in the distance, with a strange yell)
Arthur comes back, and summons a flaming sword

Vix opens up the walker
Idle casts a grenade right into the weak-spot

The Captain turns to us

We continue to massacre the battlefield

Carlos dies

Vix asks for the shrapnel launcher
barbie: 'yes bitch~'

One guy was trying to run away to a skiff
we kill him
and the skiff fucks off
