****

About half hour off the mountain, heading towards the House of Storms base
Can see 1 or 2 skiffs coming and going, otherwise quiet around

Grey ontop of the carriage
Arthur looking around and ahead
Idle is reading the Percy Jackson books
Vix is reading the Philosophical Works of Dr T A Swift

One of the skiffs notice us
x2 vandals and x2 dregs
kill them all!

grey starts scouting 30ft ahead as we continue to approach the mountain
we discuss looking for a crossbow for Arthur
find a large opening to a cave, guarded by a single wretch
grey kills it with a throwing knife then shortsword

head into cave
vix does detect light and darkness
	light from arthur's sword
	general darkness around

head further in
through the tunnels
vix cuts open the back of a tent - sees ghost shells hanging from the ceiling & beaten up man wearing a cloak and bits of broken armour chained to the wall (vix recognises him)
Vix: 'Amir, psst, Amir!'
Vix gets out, and Arthur sets the tent on fire

start combat
start chucking grenades everywhere
clean combat, killing everyone
drag amir to exit
