Wake up, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/13 DnDestiny/13.02 Wiki/Party/Idle\|Idle]] can see night through a hole in the ceiling
Locke drifts into view. Idle lies there, unsurprised, but curious.

Computer screens along the left wall, everything old as balls, covered in ice
Hand-cannon on the floor not far away

On Europe - Everdrift Ruins

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/13 DnDestiny/13.02 Wiki/Party/Locke\|Locke]] = ghost
- from the Traveler -> God -> being of pure light

Idle jumped up, nat 1, falls straight back down
- breaks both legs
- Locke heals

Idle: God is dead and I'm replacing him

Jump again
- see ruined towers (in a city)
- 1/2 ruined/constructed dome
- building that reads 'Radio 4'
Idle is unsurprised by any of it.

5 min of jumping tests
- _very_ rusty
- oil leak, slip and crack head, doesn't notice lmao
- Locke 'no you fucking died'

Radio tower - looks repared & potentially operational
- symbol on wall - recently painted
- House sigil of the Fallen

Idle: I wasn't that rude

Ambushed by 4 dregs
War Crimes Idle

senses small traces of lingering darkness in the building
- from the 4 dregs

one monitor in the radio room - reads 'Radio 4 Europa. Trasmission Ready.'
Idle plays Skillets 'Save me', then announces 'Good mooooorning Radio 4 Europa. Please save me.'
