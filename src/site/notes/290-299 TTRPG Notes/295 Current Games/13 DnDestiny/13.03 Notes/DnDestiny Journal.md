A game set in the Destiny universe, run by Lou!
Fireteam Unknown is made of the curious exo Idle-112 (Noah), stoic hunter Grey (Jake), excited hunter Sira (Lauren), chaotic warlock Vix (Justine) and steadfast titan Arthur (Kerry). They have gathered to save Earth, again. And hopefully get some loot along the way!

# Session

Gathered by Ikora
To head to the EDZ to look at why there's so much Fallen activity there.

Head to shuttle
Screaming, a thump
A guardian stands up after being rezzed - Grey

Ikora: lmao just join them, it's far too much paperwork

Grey & Ghost
Vix Moon & Barbie : engineer
Sira & Seph (?)
Arthur & Cyd
Idle & Locke 

Introduce ourselves

Arrive, shuttle doors opens.
V to B, out of hearing: I think this group is defective ...

****

Arthur starts walking away
Screaming in opposite direction
Arthur turns 180
everyone heads towards it

several horse n carts, humans around, strange alien (four arms)
arthur mounts a horse
x4 dregs, x2 vandals

Arthur _tramples_ the final one
thinks Sira _died_ when they hid

Grey searches the bodies
Takes a shock rifle
Vix looks at the Fallen - same symbol as before - Vix and Sira and Idle remember it
House of Storms

Arthur and Idle go talk to the humans
They're speaking Welsh
Back to English
'we're back from trading with a nearby village, and this ship dropped them off and fucked off!'

Arthur, Vix, and Sira try to fix the cart
Arthur _breaks_ it even more (nat1)
Vix and Sira fixing it as they go along, without Arthur noticing

they only had grain
Grainy Boys - their company name - seven of them (were eight)

Commander Betty would've fought them off
village = Abergwaun newedd
people : Governor Owain will reward you massively for helping us.

****

village surrounded by pallisades
river goes through it

Head to the governor at the town hall
there's a bit of a buzz about our arrival

owain looks So old, long grey hair and just Saggy
'anything you want you can take! but only one item'

vix after library records - w/ sira and idle
arthur & grey to tavern - v empty (its a shithole)
talk about their life story

grey : woke up, shot a robot, fixed a teleporter, died
arthur : woke up in a tomb, three years ago, been helping ppl get to the last city

a: things should've stayed as they were, nothing happened for me to be scared of ships
_arthur is a technophobe_
a: look at this place! it's perfect the way it is

barkeep slams his flagon down: get out my tavern you filthy risen scum
starts ringing a bell

****

at library - mostly ya lit
vix private vc to barbie

idle finds percy jackson: last olympian
then just a _bunch_ of cool books

sira finds a book about the governor - all in Welsh

****

we hear the bells ringing
head outside

[+1 insp]

arthur and grey surrounded by an angry mob
mob: you bring nothing but destruction! get out! risen never bring anything good!
sira: put the pitchforks away!
barbie: if we bring nothing but destruction we'll give it to you!

idle tries to calm them
mention of the lords two towns over
people in armour and horses turn up - big flower on their chest

commander betty them all to go back home, they meekly obey
betty: sorry about this, they don't appreciate the risen, but i could really use your help on a bit of an issue
b: the fallen have been attacking us for the past 25 years

idle: we'll help, where are we supposed to go?
b points to a mountain range : theyre in there
can almost see little dots going in and out

betty is gov's daughter

****

About half hour off the mountain, heading towards the House of Storms base
Can see 1 or 2 skiffs coming and going, otherwise quiet around

Grey ontop of the carriage
Arthur looking around and ahead
Idle is reading the Percy Jackson books
Vix is reading the Philosophical Works of Dr T A Swift

One of the skiffs notice us
x2 vandals and x2 dregs
kill them all!

grey starts scouting 30ft ahead as we continue to approach the mountain
we discuss looking for a crossbow for Arthur
find a large opening to a cave, guarded by a single wretch
grey kills it with a throwing knife then shortsword

head into cave
vix does detect light and darkness
	light from arthur's sword
	general darkness around

head further in
through the tunnels
vix cuts open the back of a tent - sees ghost shells hanging from the ceiling & beaten up man wearing a cloak and bits of broken armour chained to the wall (vix recognises him)
Vix: 'Amir, psst, Amir!'
Vix gets out, and Arthur sets the tent on fire

start combat
start chucking grenades everywhere
clean combat, killing everyone
drag amir to exit

</div></div>
