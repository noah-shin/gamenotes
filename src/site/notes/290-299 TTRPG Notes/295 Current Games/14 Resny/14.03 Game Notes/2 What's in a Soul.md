Church – more of a barnhouse Has misted windows, red painted bound hands on the door, lots of 'red wood flooring'

Dollshop – no-one owns it Aaravos enters with a bagn Melton's fam were taken by The Dollmaker DM has the Wand of Orcus (M's parents were coming to retrieve the wand and destroy it?) Faint constant sound of crying – from the dolls but also everywhere

Left workshop – jar of eyes, open scrolls, pulled apart stuffed doll – counter – framed pictures / papers

DOLLS W POISON NEEDLES UNDER SHELVES – needle of soul transfer

can you understand me – where am I – barrage of overlappting voices child spirits leave the doll bodies when killed
