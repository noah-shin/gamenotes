AC now 15 – bracers

Laura ' there's no-one in the hospital. They didn't turn up ' – ABOUT ANSEL – we all got lunch boxes from her – (sword dick jokes)

Laura has a magic sword? Ansel + mace of destruction Skylar + greatsword of wounding Alanis + ice longsword Yobi + poison dagger Nyx + rapier of life stealing = 10.890k ( Al pays – glucose guardian ;) )

Al picks up bracers & x6 potions of healing from Aisha's = 5.3k

Melstrom – Yobi enters, challenges Mel for a competition – minor illusion sparkles & Ansel Blesses – he served on the frontline, now has a metal proesthetic for a leg (?) – made by Amel Yobi + +2 longbow, lonely quiver, 5x16 arrows = 3k (should have been 6.675k) Ansel feeling Mel's pain, he's happy to have fun competition Mel is late 30s, very handsome

Daniel's (?) jet black hair, scarred, lots of jewelry, shady store owner Al + thieves tools, vial of basic poison, listening device, handcuffs x 3, cane sword = 1k Cold clothes, respirator, tent for everyone = 530

ANSEL HAS SIBLINGS – guardian is a busy lady at the hospital – younger sister Gazelle, 10 – older bro, 20, also at hospital – not a good relationship, never has alone time with them – Fedeeleeesesesee is the guardian? – Gazelle ' you're not dad '

Nyx's gma doesn't approve of the missions Yobi sends a dick drawing to HMWM Blaze Bandits – during the midterms, they tried to kill Alanna (the paladin teacher)

Al remembers the last moments of their missing two months w/ Damien Get's Damien sword We all head off to the tunnels An + T ' I meant the kiss ' Al + T 'Ansel isn't the right person' Ansel – was behind the scenes, doesn't know if their emotions are from themself or Taylor (though T also isn't certain nor has strong love emotions for Ansel to get confused _with_)

CULT PLACE DOOR – chanting on the other side – 'the twins' are fighting each other – announcers voice is distorted – Al starts to remember their time fighting there – THE ANNOUNCER IS ZANIXIS TEVENSHIELD – Neither Al nor Ansel want to go in lmao
