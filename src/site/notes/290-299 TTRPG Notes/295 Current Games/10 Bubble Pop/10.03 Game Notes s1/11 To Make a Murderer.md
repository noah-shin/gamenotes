Zax to Alanis –> never thought you'd be brave enough to come down here, especially not after last time, we basically killed your whole team – then casts Greater Invisibility AND FUCKS OFF

LAURA KILLS ANSEL

Al -1 Healing Potion to pick Ansel back up – misty steps to Zanax Nyx fails their tentacle backflip The twins are wearing shackles

Ansel to Laura – 'what the fuck!!' shocked and choked – spiritual weapon against her

Nyx kills the first guard! – first campaign death – magic missile darts drain his blood

ANSEL GOES DOWN AGAIN Taylor uses potion to heal

Yobi kills the second! – thunder arrow takes off the top of his head

Ansel tries a magic trick (w/ a real bloody hand), fails Skylar goes down Al backflips off the balcony, fails to break the shackle, casts Fey Presence Skylar gets his – 1 success, 2 fails

LAURA KILLS ZANE – SLICES THEIR THROAT – 2 fails

Al kills third guard, charm ends, Laura _hates Al_ Nyx kills fourth guard BY CHOKING HIM TO DEATH

Taylor uses Yobi's Healing Potion to resurrect Skylar Yobi heals Zane

NYX JUGGLES EIGHT SWORDS

YOBI'S AURA IS ALSO JET BLACK???

Yobi splits a worm lengthways Taylor does a card trick Nyx 'Remember who you are' – lion king vibes

Both Laura and Zane wake up Nyx is covered in blood and crying as they realise they've just _killed two people_

Al hyperventilates before stilling with _glowing gold eyes and markings down their skin_
