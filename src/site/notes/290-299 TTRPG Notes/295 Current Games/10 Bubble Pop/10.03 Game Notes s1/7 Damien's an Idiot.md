8.9.21

Alanis's spare time :

Scorpion Bar – owner & son (Donald Scorpion) – other's aren't trying to win Mr K – primarily loans money / provides drugs / contraband goods / underground connections (thieves guilds) / allows others to experience other people's high (?) – Ansel owes money loans / a second hand high customer – underground fighting rings – was one in the tunnels (mr K provides directions)

Kelly liked caramel ice-cream Landen would go silence when working on a song Zane used to like hanging out in the park with the team

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/Damien\|Damien]] has his new sword / no roses on his outfit at all Confrontation KISS has done a ritual to help Lei break out herself [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/Lei\|Lei]] – oath of crown but for found family (the hustlers!!) D currently doesn't have access to his powers He bought half a week to research

Nyx might get arrested if they share their gma's research Ansel couldn't read Lei's mind at the hospital (emotional background noise) Skylar's dad knows that the fight club belongs to a cult – the Pura Humanum Superiore – (other mutants were rescued there?) Damien figured out how to change/remove the controlling aspect of the shackle Al changes the controller to Damien (should have worked??)

Damien puts it on (stealing it off Al) Falls down in pain War going on in his mind (base directive vs himself / base is to kill mutants) Ansel casts Inflict Wounds on D (wild emotional instability?) D stabs himself w/ his new sword Yobi – Detect Thoughts – he's focused on the Lei ritual (needs to flood her w/ charisma magic) (if the ritual breaks, it'll get worse for Lei) Sword gives magic flames & has some extra magic bonuses

Taylor's glasses r destroyed – Yobi & Skylar see

D healed Lei in ethereal form appears Al announced their triad

Ansel is in the kitchen w/ Taylor (acting awkwardly? history between them and D?)

Taylor gets a message from [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/Benjy\|Benjy]] (needs urgent help)
