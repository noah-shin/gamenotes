Nyx & Headmaster – [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/HMWM\|HMWM]] accussed them of accessing library N – 'coerced by an outside party'

Midterms – simulations of combat Alanis + Ansel late for assembly

2 – pure white room transitions to lava room & bridge Nyx nearly falls, kerfuffle trying to save them then all run across together WE FORGOT TO TIE ROPE AROUND EACH OTHER bag at the end – 6 enchanted items – allows us to communicate silently with each other within a city – targeted communication (to individual or group text)

Ansel's blacksmith mentor guy – he's making a cool sword – who for? why is it secret? Aisha's Magical Items – Yobi steals an unknown grey potion – Ansel fails to flirt – Al gains Enchanted Decks and puts preorder for bracers ( total = 5k GP owed in a month ) ( Ansel is now an artist with their jewelry. Should we set that up? )

5 – Protection quest Looking after Yobi in the corner Things go wrong APPARENTLY A LOT OF THINGS HAVE BLINDSIGHT THIS SUCKS YOBI IS PERMADOWN – stringer from scorpion cleric teacher ressurrection (al not in room)

Alanis only takes a short rest, goes gambling all night again.

6 – Arena Team fighting against [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/Damien\|Damien]] – his mutation is blue fire (used to be red :eyes: ???) – he's still feeling super guilty (about what? Al? someone/thing else? is this just cause i took bad notes?) – 3 people go down but damien is super hurt WHY DO I KEEP MISSING WTF

Al goes gambling. Mental health die goes down. Ansel goes ??? hustling??? something in the ethereal return
