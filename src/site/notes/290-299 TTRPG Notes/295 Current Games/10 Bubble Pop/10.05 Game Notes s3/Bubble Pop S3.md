We all head to intelligence entrance, a fortress
Alanis (leader of the faction) is running late, then turns up, a lil more armoured, a lil more well dressed, a cool looking dagger (decorative), a wedding band on his finger with a small engraving and made of six different metals, a v confident aura

He lights up a projector and goes into the Intelligence faction
Tells us about our housing, our roles, etc

An alarm sounds, he leaves, very casually.

Is Yobi dead\|3. Is Yobi dead]]

violetta, has not slept, a liquid drinker
unity, spellcastery boy, magical facial tats, slept decently well
jupiter, cannot tell how long theyve been awake, they look fine and really happy! they are drinking a cup of death and motor oil looking coffee, with a purple dragon on their shoulder
quinn's been up for a couple hours, a good nights rest and active morning

knock on the door, official voice, kinda irritating, calling for summons
apparently we already missed one set

---

we head off to the intelligence hq
someone notices that there's a note - 'go here'
we can see information is moving very quickly, a very busy building
head to the conference room pointed out by the note, same as yesterday's

Mable Harvey stands at the front of the room 
- one of the generals here
- pantsuit vibes
- not obviously carrying any weapons
coughs, looks at her watch, then back up
we all filter in, sitting down
unity sits on the floor

briefing - we're getting tested today, so they can know our level
she's going to be our Point & team supervisor
she gives me her number

---

led to a large basement room
the white vague shimmer of the wall fades, sort of like an illusion, before walls and rocks materialise and grow
feels like we're in a cage with no roof, bright blue sky above us

a voice from a hidden speaker :
Mabel - your time starts now. the longer you stay here, the worse things will get for you

honey pokes the wall
immediately thrown to the right, crashing into the rocks
feeling a lil _crispier_ than you normally do, my finger feels a lil number than before

jupiter pokes a tower with a pencil
the pencil stays stuck as jupiter jumps back, realising the concrete doesn't feel like concrete
a giant ? tongue ? right where jupiter poked it
a mimic!!!

it wants to make me stick to it
jupiter sends their construct to go shoot it
it turns, and accidentally jumpscares itself (two crit fails), and sends two bombs at the gang
violetta jumps back, jupiter avoids half, unity takes it all

violetta looks around
realises something around us seems to be moving around strangely, then comes back around - its a russian doll scenario of mimics
xe figures out more about the mimics and what they are
then tries to talk to the room mimic??? seduce it?????
he caresses the floor with a foot, presses a lil harder
the mimic does a lil warning growl back
he kneels down, tries to seduce
mimic - oh, but i enjoy the fight? if you don't want to, i guess ... you've been a lot nicer than the rest
violetta - i don't wanna be here, i want to fake being asleep somewhere
mimic - i guess i could let you out, if it would please you
violetta - that would please me daddy

---

a doorway is created that we exit from

mabel - what
mabel - there was going to be further training, but. i don't think we're going to do that anymore. i need to take a break. go back to your place, we'll summon you later.

honey texts her a wink, just to give her his number
mabel phones someone and starts walking away - are you Trying to make my life hell? first the broom closet, then the office, now they've _defiled_ the training room.

---

we are back at the frat house
unity suddenly gets Hurt?

Relaxing in the frat house  
Honey gets a message from Mabel - have a job. be professional. MH.

We head to the intelligence office  
can see theres a bit of a commotion going on  
people are rushing around - reacting to something that's happened, feels vaguely planned?  
two figures (nyx & penny) standing in the bullpen

-- SECRETS --

honey and violetta clock the two figures  
nyx locks eyes with violetta, and goes pale  
starts walking towards him, then stops, turns to penny  
nyx - did i hit my head when we were coming in? are you seeing what i'm seeing?  
nyx is Fully just Staring at violetta  
penny turns, recognises violetta  
penny, whispered - what the fuck?

---

violetta waves at them, specifically at nyx  
nyx starts crying profusely  
nyx - yobi?  
violetta doesn't recognise the name  
penny starts to advance

we hear mabel yell out - Horsemen!  
penny gets in violetta's way  
nyx - it can't be them. yobi?  
nyx starts to have a panic attack, but is not a rage monster

violetta - can i help you?  
penny - who the fuck do you think you are kid?  
violetta - i just got here?  
penny - no, who the fuck do you think you are?  
violetta - i'm violetta, i got here a couple weeks ago.  
penny - from?

taylor and alanis turn up  
taylor - i know the missino went poorly, but what's going on?  
penny points at violetta like 'duh'  
alanis finally recognises him as yobi  
goes for the hug  
taylor pulls him back

alanis - who the fuck are you? where did you come from?  
violetta - i was rescued from a government outpost three weeks ago  
penny gets the vibe that violetta is talking absolute bullshit, but not sure about which parts

we head to a conference room  
i'm violetta ivanov, born in aramore, only child, was captured by the government, held for a long while, no clue, then liberated, and now i'm here  
penny coughs out - bullshit

nyx does an arcana check  
sees something that causes a lil shock

honey asks violetta for their hand & reveals their mutation  
jupiter goes 'look!' and phases their hands right through the table  
unity - i can channel the different elements

room turns to training room  
quinn's p hesitant, but caves to the peer pressure of doing something cool  
quinn - i- i've hurt ppl with this but, okay, lets go  
quinn takes unity's hand  
there's a beat, then honey blasts through the room and into a wall  
unity takes some extra terrible debuffs?  
they were pale before, and is somehow paler, a slight tremor in their hands

honey promises to create a meal plan to deal with everyone's various nutrient deficiencies

taylor just looks at violetta - so, are you going to tell us what your mutation is?  
violetta knows very little about, and has little control, over xe's mutation  
he takes off a stylish leather glove, revealing a lichtenburg scar across their hand

taylor has warmed up  
the group leaves, al with a 'watching you' gesture, penny with a final threat

---

so, missions.  
fate's hold, need to figure out how many will be there for a potential attack  
or higher ups will be in aramore  
violetta is 'unfortunately' familiar with the place

Finding out\|5. Finding out]] >>
 27/05/23

We all agree to head to Aramore

Look at the map and figure out which way to head
Grab horses
Make our way overground

First night, Quinn makes everyone take watches
Unity wakes up looking even worse
Violetta sleeps for 4 hours

Unity, Vio, and Jupiter wake up the next day, feeling a little queasy - their masks broke
Around breakfast, Vio shuffles to the firepit, grabs a cup for the coffee, then a bright blue shockwave/electrical current jumps from violetta to unity and honey

have a bit of a convco about it
vio's shock thing used to never happen and is now becoming daily?
apparently under control

Vio's mask leaked a lil more

Quinn fails to scout ahead from above

Vio and Unity do extract lil medicine checks against each other
Vio reaches towards Unity's sword
Unity dodges it, and turns the sword away
Unity: 'You don't want to do this.'
Vio: 'What's going on with that sword?'
Unity: 'It's not safe for me to explain it to you. I like you, and I don't want anything to happen to you.'

Vio promises to 'not touch the sword'
- seems genuine, but the wording feels oddly specific

---

Next morning
Honey tosses Vio a piece of copper wire before giving the morning coffee
Vio just gets hit in the face
The moment the wire touches his skin, there's an arc of electricity from his skin to the wire, holding it, before there's a bang and it rips itself apart
Everyone dodges the residual sparks as elements land in the fire, causing a small blue-green explosion (except Unity lmao)

As we're travelling, Jupiter starts to craft a battery sword thing for Vio to channel at the beginning of the day, storing the electricity for later
- Created a small steel wand

---

That night, Quinn is looking at the Prismatic Sword (Unity's sword)
- notices red, silver, and an obsidian black gem in the hilt
- not made of steel, but some kind of crystal/glass
- black hue to the blade (faintly glowing dark)

---

Next morning, Vio discharged into the rod

We start heading off
Vio and Jupiter's masks fail

Vio's loses control of xer mutation, hitting honey and unity, stunning them

Jupiter fixes on two people walking alongside us, in the wilderness, staring at them
- a tall man, but an explosion has killed him, mutilating him
- he can't speak to them, because he doesn't have a jaw
- a shorter individual, with braids plaited into her hair
- she used to be incredibly happy, but now its like there's no-one home?
Jupiter jumps off their house, yelling out 'Dad! Vi!' as they rushes towards the pair
Jupiter: 'I'm sorry! I wanted things to go right, I'm sorry!'

Jupiter chases them further into the forest

Violetta jumps off his horse, then *shoots Jupiter*
Jupiter turns, and sees a man holding the gun
Man saying : 'It's your fault, you caused this'
Jupiter yells out a scream of rage, and shoots them back with a hand crossbow
Then realises who they shot (the false one), and sighs
Jupiter : 'You're right. I'm sorry, you're right.'

Quinn gets in between them
Jupiter sees their younger brother, telling their father to shoot again
Jupiter: 'Jasper, please'

Honey tells Violetta to stand down
Goes to stun Jupiter, but Unity has an idea, so grapples them instead
Unity reaches out, a holy light, and casts Greater Restoration
the hallucinations fade away

Jupiter realises they've definitely seen this first hand before, and knows exactly what happened

Set up camp after a little bit
Jupiter examines the masks - realises the filtration system hasn't worked, and builds some new ones

2 failures, 6 successes

</div></div>

03/06/23

Arrive at camp
Honey rounds on Violetta - why???
honey - i get it, but pls ask us for support?
vio - you haven't proven yourself as useful, yet

honey - you're right, we don't want to know each other, and it seems like you don't want to
vio - you're right

everyone sets up
unity scooches their bedroll next to violettas
violetta stares them down
unity : 'i believe your icy facade is merely hiding your deep seated loneliness'

jupiter takes first watch - staring into middle distance
honey checks if violetta is awake, then invites them to next to them
honey offers their trail mix - violetta eats all the raisins & dried fruit
unity takes third watch
violetta stays next to them until half way through, when he goes to bed

---

violetta wakes jupiter for the discharge rod
vio : 'are you good? after yesterday?'
jupiter  : 'everything is fine!'
honey: 'you know that's worse, right?'

jess does something for the skill check
- xe has a building nervous energy - though not from anything specific - whilst we travel

we begin to enter aramore - stealthing
we _barely_ pass the dc

violetta lets us know what building we're after
we start stealthing into it
failure (narrowly avoiding a crit fail)
a city guard calls for jupiter to halt
- everyone gets caught
- but honey hides and is not captured

guards: do yall have any id?
jupiter: what's that?
guard: you know, who you are, where you were born?
jupiter: i don't know where i was born

violetta spits in one guards face
he gets immediately arrested

unity starts flirting and pretending innocence
shows their id - guard looks at it, looks at unity, etc, then scans the id
the guard immediately pulls out a gun and goes : 'put your hands in the air right now'
guard: 'you are under arrest for crimes against the church of helm, and have committed treason against the church'

---

everyone gets taken to this government building
- 45 floors
- same as all the others, very uniform
- grey and slate

as we go in, four guards surrounding one man (wearing these odd cuffs glowing a grey light), with two scientists also flanking him
vio jerks at the sight
unity notices that it's more than a jerk - vio fully stops to look
honey notices a minute exchange between the pair - the eyes lock, the guy looks away, and super subtly shakes his head at vio

guy is 6'3, tanned skin, late 40's early 50s, dull dark red yes with orange flecks, blonde hair with a natural wave falling out of a manbun, looks like he's been through a Lot

honey picks up on a vibe - this is a man who is very protective over violetta, parental authority

honey can see a plain black lanyard on him - ryan matlock
scientists have name badges reading 'flint-ryder', 'dane'
guards have badges reading 'wood', 'wood', 'bane', and 'stone'

jupiter and honey have seen similar designs of these cuffs before
honey has seen them on the front lines
- government deployed mutant soldiers that they had conscripted
jupiter has seen them on 

the cuffs act as a suppressor, preventing them from using their power (doesn't transfer it though, unlike season 1)
- usually glow the colour of the person's power

---

guy is being lead to the door

violetta is pushed along
when he explodes with emotional distress
killing one of the guards
all the guards around the gang are badly hurt

the guards around the stranger stagger
honey fakes a fall, and copies his mutation
- spirit animals & pack bonds

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.05 Game Notes s3/5. Secret Extra Stuff 1\|5. Secret Extra Stuff 1]]

honey picks themself up, faking apologies
and picks the stranger's handcuffs

guy suddenly rapidly heals
summons the spirit animals to start attacking (quinn mirrors him)
guy: 'vio, get your ass in gear!'

jupiter sets off the discharge rod
it chains lightning most of the guards (15 out of 20), dealing 49 dmg, burning and killing them
jupiter starts cackling like a mad scientist

violetta rushes to the front desk to hack it and collect as much data as possible

honey picks unity's locks, accidentally touches them
copies their mutation

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.05 Game Notes s3/5. Secret Extra Stuff 2\|5. Secret Extra Stuff 2]]

unity casts black tentacles
they grow out the ground and grapple the guards remaining in the room

jupiter shoots electricity in a line through the ones trapped
the stranger's wolf tears through the final one next to the clone of honey

honey is on one knee, starting to hyperventilate
he gets dragged along, and the training kicks in enough that he runs, but his eyes are glazed over

we head into the armoured van, ryan behind the wheel, and we zoom off

</div></div>
