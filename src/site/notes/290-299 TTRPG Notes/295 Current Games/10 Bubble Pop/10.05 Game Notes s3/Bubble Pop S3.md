We all head to intelligence entrance, a fortress
Alanis (leader of the faction) is running late, then turns up, a lil more armoured, a lil more well dressed, a cool looking dagger (decorative), a wedding band on his finger with a small engraving and made of six different metals, a v confident aura

He lights up a projector and goes into the Intelligence faction
Tells us about our housing, our roles, etc

An alarm sounds, he leaves, very casually.

Is Yobi dead\|3. Is Yobi dead]]

violetta, has not slept, a liquid drinker
unity, spellcastery boy, magical facial tats, slept decently well
jupiter, cannot tell how long theyve been awake, they look fine and really happy! they are drinking a cup of death and motor oil looking coffee, with a purple dragon on their shoulder
quinn's been up for a couple hours, a good nights rest and active morning

knock on the door, official voice, kinda irritating, calling for summons
apparently we already missed one set

---

we head off to the intelligence hq
someone notices that there's a note - 'go here'
we can see information is moving very quickly, a very busy building
head to the conference room pointed out by the note, same as yesterday's

Mable Harvey stands at the front of the room 
- one of the generals here
- pantsuit vibes
- not obviously carrying any weapons
coughs, looks at her watch, then back up
we all filter in, sitting down
unity sits on the floor

briefing - we're getting tested today, so they can know our level
she's going to be our Point & team supervisor
she gives me her number

---

led to a large basement room
the white vague shimmer of the wall fades, sort of like an illusion, before walls and rocks materialise and grow
feels like we're in a cage with no roof, bright blue sky above us

a voice from a hidden speaker :
Mabel - your time starts now. the longer you stay here, the worse things will get for you

honey pokes the wall
immediately thrown to the right, crashing into the rocks
feeling a lil _crispier_ than you normally do, my finger feels a lil number than before

jupiter pokes a tower with a pencil
the pencil stays stuck as jupiter jumps back, realising the concrete doesn't feel like concrete
a giant ? tongue ? right where jupiter poked it
a mimic!!!

it wants to make me stick to it
jupiter sends their construct to go shoot it
it turns, and accidentally jumpscares itself (two crit fails), and sends two bombs at the gang
violetta jumps back, jupiter avoids half, unity takes it all

violetta looks around
realises something around us seems to be moving around strangely, then comes back around - its a russian doll scenario of mimics
xe figures out more about the mimics and what they are
then tries to talk to the room mimic??? seduce it?????
he caresses the floor with a foot, presses a lil harder
the mimic does a lil warning growl back
he kneels down, tries to seduce
mimic - oh, but i enjoy the fight? if you don't want to, i guess ... you've been a lot nicer than the rest
violetta - i don't wanna be here, i want to fake being asleep somewhere
mimic - i guess i could let you out, if it would please you
violetta - that would please me daddy

---

a doorway is created that we exit from

mabel - what
mabel - there was going to be further training, but. i don't think we're going to do that anymore. i need to take a break. go back to your place, we'll summon you later.

honey texts her a wink, just to give her his number
mabel phones someone and starts walking away - are you Trying to make my life hell? first the broom closet, then the office, now they've _defiled_ the training room.

---

we are back at the frat house
unity suddenly gets Hurt?

Relaxing in the frat house
Honey gets a message from Mabel - have a job. be professional. MH.

We head to the intelligence office
can see theres a bit of a commotion going on
people are rushing around - reacting to something that's happened, feels vaguely planned?
two figures (nyx & penny) standing in the bullpen

-- SECRETS --

honey and violetta clock the two figures
nyx locks eyes with violetta, and goes pale
starts walking towards him, then stops, turns to penny
nyx - did i hit my head when we were coming in? are you seeing what i'm seeing?
nyx is Fully just Staring at violetta
penny turns, recognises violetta
penny, whispered - what the fuck?

---

violetta waves at them, specifically at nyx
nyx starts crying profusely
nyx - yobi?
violetta doesn't recognise the name
penny starts to advance

we hear mabel yell out - Horsemen!
penny gets in violetta's way
nyx - it can't be them. yobi?
nyx starts to have a panic attack, but is not a rage monster

violetta - can i help you?
penny - who the fuck do you think you are kid?
violetta - i just got here?
penny - no, who the fuck do you think you are?
violetta - i'm violetta, i got here a couple weeks ago.
penny - from?

taylor and alanis turn up
taylor - i know the missino went poorly, but what's going on?
penny points at violetta like 'duh'
alanis finally recognises him as yobi
goes for the hug
taylor pulls him back

alanis - who the fuck are you? where did you come from?
violetta - i was rescued from a government outpost three weeks ago
penny gets the vibe that violetta is talking absolute bullshit, but not sure about which parts

we head to a conference room
i'm violetta ivanov, born in aramore, only child, was captured by the government, held for a long while, no clue, then liberated, and now i'm here
penny coughs out - bullshit

nyx does an arcana check
sees something that causes a lil shock

honey asks violetta for their hand & reveals their mutation
jupiter goes 'look!' and phases their hands right through the table
unity - i can channel the different elements

room turns to training room
quinn's p hesitant, but caves to the peer pressure of doing something cool
quinn - i- i've hurt ppl with this but, okay, lets go
quinn takes unity's hand
there's a beat, then honey blasts through the room and into a wall
unity takes some extra terrible debuffs?
they were pale before, and is somehow paler, a slight tremor in their hands

honey promises to create a meal plan to deal with everyone's various nutrient deficiencies



taylor just looks at violetta - so, are you going to tell us what your mutation is?
violetta knows very little about, and has little control, over xe's mutation
he takes off a stylish leather glove, revealing a lichtenburg scar across their hand

taylor has warmed up
the group leaves, al with a 'watching you' gesture, penny with a final threat

---

so, missions. 
fate's hold, need to figure out how many will be there for a potential attack
or higher ups will be in aramore
	violetta is 'unfortunately' familiar with the place
