Is Yobi dead\|3. Is Yobi dead]]

violetta, has not slept, a liquid drinker
unity, spellcastery boy, magical facial tats, slept decently well
jupiter, cannot tell how long theyve been awake, they look fine and really happy! they are drinking a cup of death and motor oil looking coffee, with a purple dragon on their shoulder
quinn's been up for a couple hours, a good nights rest and active morning

knock on the door, official voice, kinda irritating, calling for summons
apparently we already missed one set

we head off to the intelligence hq
someone notices that there's a note - 'go here'
we can see information is moving very quickly, a very busy building
head to the conference room pointed out by the note, same as yesterday's

Mable Harvey stands at the front of the room 
- one of the generals here
- pantsuit vibes
- not obviously carrying any weapons
coughs, looks at her watch, then back up
we all filter in, sitting down
unity sits on the floor

briefing - we're getting tested today, so they can know our level
she's going to be our Point & team supervisor
she gives me her number

led to a large basement room
the white vague shimmer of the wall fades, sort of like an illusion, before walls and rocks materialise and grow
feels like we're in a cage with no roof, bright blue sky above us

a voice from a hidden speaker :
Mabel - your time starts now. the longer you stay here, the worse things will get for you

honey pokes the wall
immediately thrown to the right, crashing into the rocks
feeling a lil _crispier_ than you normally do, my finger feels a lil number than before

jupiter pokes a tower with a pencil
the pencil stays stuck as jupiter jumps back, realising the concrete doesn't feel like concrete
a giant ? tongue ? right where jupiter poked it
a mimic!!!

it wants to make me stick to it
jupiter sends their construct to go shoot it
it turns, and accidentally jumpscares itself (two crit fails), and sends two bombs at the gang
violetta jumps back, jupiter avoids half, unity takes it all

violetta looks around
realises something around us seems to be moving around strangely, then comes back around - its a russian doll scenario of mimics
xe figures out more about the mimics and what they are
then tries to talk to the room mimic??? seduce it?????
he caresses the floor with a foot, presses a lil harder
the mimic does a lil warning growl back
he kneels down, tries to seduce
mimic - oh, but i enjoy the fight? if you don't want to, i guess ... you've been a lot nicer than the rest
violetta - i don't wanna be here, i want to fake being asleep somewhere
mimic - i guess i could let you out, if it would please you
violetta - that would please me daddy

a doorway is created that we exit from

mabel - what
mabel - there was going to be further training, but. i don't think we're going to do that anymore. i need to take a break. go back to your place, we'll summon you later.

honey texts her a wink, just to give her his number
mabel phones someone and starts walking away - are you Trying to make my life hell? first the broom closet, then the office, now they've _defiled_ the training room.

we are back at the frat house
unity suddenly gets Hurt?
