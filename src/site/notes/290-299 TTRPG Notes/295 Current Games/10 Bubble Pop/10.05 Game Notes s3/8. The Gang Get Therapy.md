quinn starts driving everyone back home

everyone is layers of exhaustion, numbness, repression, etc

gonna be 2 1/2 days

vio sees a ... man-made structure?
yells to stop
isn't wearing their seatbelt
nearly goes through the front window
gets caught around the neck and waist by unity
who immediately starts yelling at xem

asks to reverse
then goes 'im sure it was nothing'
quinn looks around - its v windy and dusty, like her senses are playing a trick - optical illusions and corner of the eye

jupiter marks the spot on the map

we manage to drive away
can see the energy thrumming through the bubble still - silver and pale green

walk through the underground
head back to base
report to mable
vio hides the fact that they got info from the base

alanis comes by
jupiter goes to their dad with unity
al talks with unity and vio

unity : my name is kia kylan (and associations with darkpit), and may have many people after me
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.05 Game Notes s3/8.1 Kia Kylan history\|8.1 Kia Kylan history]]
some members of the government may now realise that i am alive
i don't know if they know i'm here or not, but i need  to prepared in case they do

al's group did not provide the id docs to this group

have a full lil heart to heart
- al knows about unity
- and so does vio now
- unity died
- and sometimes gets possessed by 'entities'

vio doesn't share anything
and al half threatens xim

agree to help jupiter create - maybe bracers for quinn?
IM WEEPING

jupiter : is carlos in?

the receptionist - leliana, wants jupiter's number to book a lab session w/ the dad
THE DAD IS SO WONDERFUL
WITH HIS PIE PUN TIE

quinn _really_ wants a dad hug but _cannot_ let himself accept it, so starts home
jupiter starts making bracers w/ their dad
