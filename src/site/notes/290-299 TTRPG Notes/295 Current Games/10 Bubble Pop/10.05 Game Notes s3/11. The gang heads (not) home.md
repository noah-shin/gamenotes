We decide to head back to the outskirts of Angelos - not in, but to be nearby.

Quinn goes through the Icarus file
	last sighted between mb and fates hold, and one of the islands between angelos and dp
	last combat sighting not recorded
	two underground bases recorded as research facilities for the gov
		one is likely to be the home base, and the other a secondary one
		one base near fates hold, one near middlesborough

heading down the tunnels, slowly, towards the base
behind and above us, loud explosion
then a couple of people jump down the escape hatches
	one wearing an outfit with a lot of gold, limping, and helping someone else
	other clad all in black - not taylor
	plus two more - met during my downtime in training

quinn scuffs a rock
group turn to look at them & recognise them

alanis realised that he'd gone dark when he'd tried contacting for support and nothing worked
	never happened before
had gone looking for info, but nothing new on the system about taylor

all head back to int sector
as soon as al walks back through, see mable damien and lei arguing

all head to meeting room
damien at door like to stop al leaving
our group debrief about the tunnels first
alanis talks about the comms going down

lei turns to jupiter and vio
	asks for them to investigate the issue
	bing bong vio gets a 27 tech check
	no records of anyone turning off the comms
	can tell that it was like nothing was getting transmitted in, not that it was blocked from being received
	jupiter can't find anything specific ? tells everyone - quinn gets none of it lmao
	must of been localised mechanical failure or jammer

vio also hands over the usb stick
discusses the two bases
robert (missing person's guy) comes in
takes the stick to decrypt it

taylor wasnt in the holding cells
	couldnt comm back then
there were a lot of people there, probably a trap
managed to get out alright
didn't get very much information from the system - but taylor wasn't being held there

we're gonna go on the military detachment for the next section
heading to a base to go rescue taylor - the middlesborough

we find a car
honey driving, jupiter shotgun, josh asleep in the back

take a break for the night
vio takes first watch
	starts going through josh's bag
	gets caught
	vio : i promise not to go through your stuff tonight, or for the journey

jupiter takes second
	can see vague movement - a car/truck lights pass by
	but they don't notice us

honey takes third
	nothing happens
josh takes fourth
	nothing happens
unity takes fifth
	also going through josh's bag
	josh wakes up

josh drives us into middlesborough
	the green forests are now skeletal black trees
	the buildings are crashed by the shards of the bubble jutting out of the ground
	black sickened ground across the city, with patches of dark red moss
	no standing structures
