kia leaves a second cup of coffee for vio every morning

near end of downtime, we meet up to have family dinner
jupiter, offering a taco to vio : i'm sorry for stabbing you in the chest

jupiter: maybe we should improve our communication?
vio: yeah, we don't really ... know anything about each other

2 truths 1 lie

quinn goes first, talks about walker

jupiter : when i was growing up , my family had to run away from the government multiple times
jupiter : my dad and sister are currently missing
jupiter : i fucking love pickles
jupiter : i miss my dad jason very much, jasper (other sibling) works in the humanitarian sector
jupiter : i went and had a meeting with robert, and he helped me track down their mutation energy signatures
jupiter : they're hopefully not in darkpit, but we don't know, cause its all demon energy. they're most likely in middlesborough
jupiter : i'm pretty good friends with taylor, cause i was born in middlesborough
jupiter : they went missing when we had to flee into the irradiated wasted from our home of the science ranch, about a year ago

vio : i grew up a big gov groupie
vio : i don't like peaches
vio : i am an only child
vio : and up till a week ago i thought they were all true

unity has personal history with necromancy?
unity : i was not the only one on the other side, i was once one of those paladins of helm
unity : but there's a reason i'm here now and not with them

vio : i never worked with the mutant experiments
vio: but i have family that are not really family, but who work in the gov in unspecified roles

unity : i have never witnessed someone from my family dying
unity : i have a lost sibling (lie)
unity : and i love peaches

later the next week, head to a training room to figure out each other's play styles

quinn goes first, displaying flurry of blows and stunning strike
jupiter goes next, hitting w/ their short sword, dragon breathing a line of fire, then one overdrive megabolt
jupiter : if you see the dragon open its mouth, stay away, unless i'm healing you

vio pulls out a bunch of guns
vio : i'm a very sneaky shooty guy
vio : and i've been training with taylor to get better control over mutation - so i can charge weapons,  and can do a grenade attack thing that arcs off

unity imbues their weapon w/ some energy, before striking, which causes a line of darkness to pass between them
then there's multiple version that all strike at the same time

mabel summons us for a meeting, for another mission

recon missions in fates hold, darkpit, and middlesborough

vio - scarlette white

we each get x2 masks, x2 healing potions

jupiter spends the night checking the masks, before we head off the next morning

head through the underground
walking, camping through the evening with a watch schedule - vio, jupiter, quinn, kia

jupiter gets distracted by a moth
quinn wakes up to the sound and light people searching ? parallel to us - but moves past of us
second patrol during quinn's watch - able to keep track of a few different pairs of uniformed patrols
