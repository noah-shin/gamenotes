We all agree to head to Aramore

Look at the map and figure out which way to head
Grab horses
Make our way overground

First night, Quinn makes everyone take watches
Unity wakes up looking even worse
Violetta sleeps for 4 hours

Unity, Vio, and Jupiter wake up the next day, feeling a little queasy - their masks broke
Around breakfast, Vio shuffles to the firepit, grabs a cup for the coffee, then a bright blue shockwave/electrical current jumps from violetta to unity and honey

have a bit of a convco about it
vio's shock thing used to never happen and is now becoming daily?
apparently under control

Vio's mask leaked a lil more

Quinn fails to scout ahead from above

Vio and Unity do extract lil medicine checks against each other
Vio reaches towards Unity's sword
Unity dodges it, and turns the sword away
Unity: 'You don't want to do this.'
Vio: 'What's going on with that sword?'
Unity: 'It's not safe for me to explain it to you. I like you, and I don't want anything to happen to you.'

Vio promises to 'not touch the sword'
- seems genuine, but the wording feels oddly specific

---

Next morning
Honey tosses Vio a piece of copper wire before giving the morning coffee
Vio just gets hit in the face
The moment the wire touches his skin, there's an arc of electricity from his skin to the wire, holding it, before there's a bang and it rips itself apart
Everyone dodges the residual sparks as elements land in the fire, causing a small blue-green explosion (except Unity lmao)

As we're travelling, Jupiter starts to craft a battery sword thing for Vio to channel at the beginning of the day, storing the electricity for later
- Created a small steel wand

---

That night, Quinn is looking at the Prismatic Sword (Unity's sword)
- notices red, silver, and an obsidian black gem in the hilt
- not made of steel, but some kind of crystal/glass
- black hue to the blade (faintly glowing dark)

---

Next morning, Vio discharged into the rod

We start heading off
Vio and Jupiter's masks fail

Vio's loses control of xer mutation, hitting honey and unity, stunning them

Jupiter fixes on two people walking alongside us, in the wilderness, staring at them
- a tall man, but an explosion has killed him, mutilating him
- he can't speak to them, because he doesn't have a jaw
- a shorter individual, with braids plaited into her hair
- she used to be incredibly happy, but now its like there's no-one home?
Jupiter jumps off their house, yelling out 'Dad! Vi!' as they rushes towards the pair
Jupiter: 'I'm sorry! I wanted things to go right, I'm sorry!'

Jupiter chases them further into the forest

Violetta jumps off his horse, then *shoots Jupiter*
Jupiter turns, and sees a man holding the gun
Man saying : 'It's your fault, you caused this'
Jupiter yells out a scream of rage, and shoots them back with a hand crossbow
Then realises who they shot (the false one), and sighs
Jupiter : 'You're right. I'm sorry, you're right.'

Quinn gets in between them
Jupiter sees their younger brother, telling their father to shoot again
Jupiter: 'Jasper, please'

Honey tells Violetta to stand down
Goes to stun Jupiter, but Unity has an idea, so grapples them instead
Unity reaches out, a holy light, and casts Greater Restoration
the hallucinations fade away

Jupiter realises they've definitely seen this first hand before, and knows exactly what happened

Set up camp after a little bit
Jupiter examines the masks - realises the filtration system hasn't worked, and builds some new ones

2 failures, 6 successes
