30/8

In our stalking era
sneak into achyls' house
	penny distracts her dad
	head to achy's room to plan

ansel heads out via front door
	knocks on rand's office
	lmao randy about mr rand

head to main street
a&a, nyx & sky & pen

achy's mom dissapeared 3 / 4 months ago
	big churchgoer
	'i guess she's been kidnapped
	she had a cold and they cured her
	then she thought they would save everything

nyx and penny flirting

paladins approaching
go abnormally still
ground underneath shimmers
all three drop through the ground
time slows (chronomancy based)
the ground is real but the paladins are phasing through
moment of panic for all pallys - falling fast but can't speak or do anything
ground shimmering in golden sigil
- shape ansel drew in blood
- conrad's patron
they fall three and glowing has stopped

achy throws a ball bearing
ground shimmers again, but no slow
ball bearing bounces down steps
we feel like we're being invited

penny texts conrad
_its not him_
fail wis save
'fuck you'
penny hit by image of parents
- but older, but a 10 year old boy, playing together
- heads 'they used this power to start afresh'
- feels need to unearth the power to aid it
- conrad knows what he's doing, right?
- he must be saving it to tell me at the right moment
- - now, to join his crusade
stealing power was just the beginning
this is the endgame
- take down the church
- stop people being pawns of the church
