Cartoon villan vs happy bandits guy (HP wins)
Skylar vs Penny (P wins)

Octavio vs Ansel
- O sees something on Ansel's armour (paint?) and shuts up
- Fight keeps matching
- Ansel tries a Divine Intervention
-- A change over Ansel's features - rage and darkness around them
-- An slices through the wood of the pickaxe, doesn't look like they'll stop
-- An hearing a dark voice
- Yobi casts Detect Thoughts
-- Pulled into a dark void
--- Ansel sees bald older gentleman (Odin), holding a decorated spear
--- Only emotion present is agression
--- He puts the tip of his spear under Ansel's throat, tips their head back
' You broke our deal. Did you think there are no consequences? I gave you the means of revenge and you gave up?! I seek revenge now.'
--- He picks Ansel up by the throat, stabs him in the stomach.
Odin ' I take payment in blood. Yours, or someone else's, you decide.'
Ansel 'Mine'
Odin 'I thought you'd be smarter. I thought you'd ask what I meant by 'yours''

Yobi beams the image to the rest of the party
- We all feel those waves of heavy agression

An doesn't have any magic - depleted/blocked
- Led to back room by Katy

Ferdi vs Nyx (F wins)
Penny bows out the final
Jayden vs Ferdi (J wins)

We all head to backroom
Y 'uncomplicate it for us'
An 'Back in Middlesborough, that shit led me to breaking my pact with my God. Things weren't the way we thought they were, as you know, and my god got mad.'
An 'But I thought it was okay and not that serious. But push came to shove and now I don't have magic.'
An 'I've been seeing things since I got here. I don't think he's too happy with me being here. He took my eye a year around, around when we joined that group.'

We notice that their eye moves independetly, An not controlling it.

Nyx attempts to call Vicky
- rings, doesn't go through
- she only allows certain ppl through during the workday
Ansel calls, phone rings for ages.
- Finally picked up, muffled, lots of noise, groaning and alarms
- There's a gurgle, she sounds _hurt_.
An 'Vicky. Please.'
V 'Nothing. Suits. Men attack. Not safe. Don't return. I tried getting to them. They're gone. So much blood, I can't, I wish I could move to them. Damien, Lei, Al. They're over there. I can't do anything'
We hear a series of explosions, deep, like Vicky's mutation.

Party sacrifices levels to try and resurrect folks :!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

25/06

Downtime

(lost the first page of notes lmao sos) (smthg about an assembly) (spooky vision) (nyx and ansel's downtime?)

Penny – spends it red threading connections between the people who died – x2 unconscious and x1 dead in the past two weeks — its sped up — cara and betti on same day (betty went missing the day before) —– they were together in the club —– Da was friends with Jackson (?)

-   dead people seem random-ish — not assigned to a group — top A ranks are dying — person dying coincides with paladins going missing
    
-   paladins going missing in a rotation? — every three weeks — random within the week
    
-   last taken 2 ½ weeks ago
    
-   no traces
    
-   along the same route — between the two underground connections
    
-   paladins don't have a family (renounced) (weakening connection to Helm)
    

Achlys – walks into VP Rand's office – convinces him to leave for a bit – finds the tournament itenirary — 1) dragon maze with riddles —– winner gets advs in the other tasks — 2) quiz — 3) battle between teams

-   teams from Darkpit are the Talons and us
-   from XXX – lightning coolers and stormbreaker – elemental magics
-   from XXX – chosen light and highfliers – celestial based
    
-   can find nothing from HM — rand seems to have all the power
    
-   hacks the comp — no name assigned to anything in 3 ½ years — Erun Crosshand —– cannot recall a matching face or even the name

-   nothing major coincided — other than turnover of teachers who retired — previous VP retired 5 years ago


Skylar – training telepathy and physical str — new and improved feat

</div></div>

30/8

In our stalking era
sneak into achyls' house
	penny distracts her dad
	head to achy's room to plan

ansel heads out via front door
	knocks on rand's office
	lmao randy about mr rand

head to main street
a&a, nyx & sky & pen

achy's mom dissapeared 3 / 4 months ago
	big churchgoer
	'i guess she's been kidnapped
	she had a cold and they cured her
	then she thought they would save everything

nyx and penny flirting

paladins approaching
go abnormally still
ground underneath shimmers
all three drop through the ground
time slows (chronomancy based)
the ground is real but the paladins are phasing through
moment of panic for all pallys - falling fast but can't speak or do anything
ground shimmering in golden sigil
- shape ansel drew in blood
- conrad's patron
they fall three and glowing has stopped

achy throws a ball bearing
ground shimmers again, but no slow
ball bearing bounces down steps
we feel like we're being invited

penny texts conrad
_its not him_
fail wis save
'fuck you'
penny hit by image of parents
- but older, but a 10 year old boy, playing together
- heads 'they used this power to start afresh'
- feels need to unearth the power to aid it
- conrad knows what he's doing, right?
- he must be saving it to tell me at the right moment
- - now, to join his crusade
stealing power was just the beginning
this is the endgame
- take down the church
- stop people being pawns of the church

27/8

we look at the stairs
nyx 5 insight check
spend _hours_ walking down the stairs
nothing to the sides, growing walls, encased

reach a doorway
above are braziers, baphomet's sigil in the walls
head a grinding, the door behind us is no longer there
muffled noises in the distance

we're in the ABYSS
doorways to abyss formed by the Collapse
punishment from the gods to the world

turn corner to see stell bull and minotaur
a&a start to turn to stone
p 'why have you put obstacles in our way?'
b 'my helpers must be strong. i do not accept weakness. i will weed out the unworthy'

ansel nat 1 wis save
transported to the hall of a thousand doors

penny realised bapho has thralled conrad recently
bull killed
it shimmers,  turns to stone, then dust

ansel - in the hallway
automatically walks to odin's room
o : you have an influence in the brain and i don't like my things being messed with
o : the way out requires a door, but doorways are tricky in the abyss
o : me saving you would cause a war, and you're not worht going to war over
a : let me milk this opportunity

nyx and sky recognise the flowing form of lei!
lei : i leave yall for three weeks! 
l : where's yobi?
l : the gov are buffoons, we're still on the run
l : did you not think that the soul draining thing was trying to leave the abyss?

achyls kills the mino

lei : we're being hunted. they may be aware you're all in darkpit
l : we have info. we need to meet, we'll be there soon

ansel sees overview of maze through the fake eye
head to a north room (still compelled)
hear sobbing, feel fear

walk in, a&a&p fail wis save
ansel sees amille and laura at home
' we didn't mean to scare you away. when are you coming home? '
sees the undercity get attacked
sees self finding amille and laura, dead

penny sees bubble city being created
watching parents set up a device from a control tower
hears a noise, then everything goes wrong
this time, its all fine, i have a younger brother
tinkering in my room, head a voice behind me, brother touches the wrong wire, everything goes black
this is what you wish for?
now conrad standing infront, eyes black
soulless laughter, he's enjoyed toying with me
raise gun to take him out, can't shoot him
irl raising gun to nothing (darkness is coalescing into a form infront of me)

achy sees perfect life, mother never got ill, so stayed with her
found a perfect team, became a government soldier
loses the entire team, because you're stealthed, and this is what you're good at
but not good enough
and you fall
come back, this team is _good_
but not sure if helping or hindering, but is this team working for the right goal, right people?
sees dad writing research, things that oppose Helm, and he's laughing

shadowy figure, no features visible, hear laughter
he's enjoying the emotional turmoil
he's gone, we pulled out of the trances

corner of room where shadows linger
ansel tosses a light stone
it flares and is swallowed by the dark
see writings of a madman across the walls
wall is undamaged by a bullet
achy touches it
ansel hears chuckling from the darkness
	pulls achy away
as we leave, achy hears a whispered 'i want a home'

next room, hear praying
ac stalths up, sees the three pallys who fell
room has number of corpses wearing the same armour
achy fakes being a dead pally
x2 pallys 'the watcher must be looking out for us as he sent you. our brothers are in between life and death'
one yawns, then falls fully unconscious

the watcher never changes, he's protected
pray to help and the watcher contacts us

we all 'pray' together
only pen and achy actually praying
nyx and sky mouthing it
ansel not even bothering
penny and achy fail wis save, tempted by our own shadow - convinced to head left

reach left room, achy reads Abyssal runes on it
a ritual room, sealed by chains
ach attacks the chain, then just pulls it off - burns their hand
lock revealed behind the chains
achy picks lock, door swings open to a deafened room
achy steps in, sits cross legged on the dias, candles start flickering

black shadowy figures reaching out from the walls, some fully stepping out
full figure behind ansel, a hand grapss his shoulder, then phases into him
ansel feels this cold
shadows urge penny to leave

make our way to the central room
chains of mithril unbar the way
room w/ cobblestones, gold and mithril statues
seven portals made of black and red vortexes = gradiant left to right
one in center on a raised dias

urge to through one of the gold statues
abyssal etchings around the doors
labelled 201-400, etc
gold statue labeled 'upper plane'
also reads 'savrifice knowledge or secret'
- means reveal a secret or give a memory (memory is random)

achy chooses knowledge rip
portal shows achy in an unfamiliar room - dep's office
searching through computer, strange files on screen
abyssal and deep speech
name unseen as she scrolls too fast
a run by Irune Crosshand - HM?

nyx gives secret - i killed my grandma the night the bubble fell
skylar secret - my adopted parents were responsible for the massacre in middlesborough
penny - i engineering my own coma
ansel - i need to kill someone for odin. I didn't want my loved ones to die so I'll someone else's
elijah - it'll be nice to see the sunshine for the first time in a millenia

8/10

Arrive at the edge of town - by entrance to the underground
before us are four shadowy figures and one more menacing figure
' thanks for the ride, i'll see what we can get up to. 25 hours and we should be done'

TIMER STARTS

achy's mutation - sees timer of our deaths above our heads
all the same rn

head home
conrad manically laughing next to bella
talons fully drained and unconscious
both have symbol of baphomet
been 'not them' for at least a year
- baphomet's generals
- ria and ven
' we want energy to power a ritual that will release baphomet and destroy the world'

head to DP Rand's
he's not home
office a tipe, computer _expertly_ wiped
trace elements of divination magic in the room - cast from the desk recently, very strong
(pallys also use divininationg magice and magic use can be shielded)

rand doesn't pick up
benjy - dealing w/ a situation, won't be much help rn
'im not in darkpit, something happened with our friends, i'm going to help

head to the school
some rooms unlocked
can't hack the office comp
get password, refind info on headmaster
meeting schedule w/ W, then he becomes less present in the school
there are a couple of appointments w/ W, but W never met w/ Rand

Ansel gets 'giddyness' from the spooky gym
shadows emerge from the equipment
_ansels str down by 2_
win - shadow ran away
locking mechanism is broken, door frame missing the bold
the drag marks go _into_ the gym

head to church
bash on the door, meet a dude
climb the wall, calm emotions on dude
head into church
achy sneaks into a bedroom
- person on the bed, doesn't react to a slap
- HES DEAD

penny shoots the air, nothing happens
head down corridor, shoot again
x2 pallys emerge, start heading towards us
one falls forward, two shadow blades in their back
next also stabbed twice, doesn't die

shadowy figures talk to us
achy and pen not to be harmed?

22/10

penny gives potion of healing to a downed ansel

head to investigate offices - no signs to Watcher or to Baphomet
achy notices celestial runes etched into the floor
penny reads - magic of protection, hiding, locks, alarms, alerts - means a trap
in a 5x10 outline in corner of room

head to individual prep rooms
very regimental, same stuff in each room
minor personalisation, initials hidden on the walls or desk
names written into front pages of notebooks and prayer books
list of names!
names match the initials

one notebook - Jasper's - is slightly different
he believed in what he was doing, but not in Helm
used the notebook more like a diary than report
has more questions
' we haven't heard from the Watcher in a while'
'our orders have changed but they're supposed to still be from the Watcher?'
questions are not new and go back roughly three years
- things changes since then

ansel spils the tea about the headmaster, the bubble, and decapitation
ansel remembers something Taylor said about how the previous bubbles fell - should not have fallen so easily
there is a way to unlink the bubble and headteacher

ansel tries to phone taylor - goes through
T : we were unlinking the headteachers before killing them - but the bubbles fell anyway
T : we put the power into a generator into a runic circle our cleric found a deity to protect
T : ritual takes 6 hours
T : only ppl who could do it are taylor, prescott, the cleric, and cadis (who's now dead)

cadis is penny's dad

Taylor will send some cordinates to penny -  someone interesting is waiting and looking for them
is the cleric - on the underground's side and would never betray us
also helped heal ansel
it's pennys mom
underground found her, presumed dead, in the rubble of the explosion

conrad and bella's shadows are Soulstinger Demons
penny needs to get into their thoughts to free them

achy's dad moved to darkpit 3 1/2 years ago
came from Angelos
cause not much for the dad before - he was the warlock form head and RS teacher
dep head position fell into his lap

look through all rooms for achy's mom
all dead but Caleb - tall ginger green eyes freckles, terrified in a corner
no mom
get a bunch of healing potions from the stockroom

head to fight club to sleep

morning
achy's dad DECLINES THE CALL
lei and team arrive!

Arriving back at the warehouse
Walk in, it looks really different
Lei in process of drawing massive sigil on the floor

two teams push tay/ansel together
al bets damien 50gp and movie night that ansel fucks up
ansel walks up to t

after a minute, an: so......
t: we were all dead, i was dying, then the government, then torture, al got out of the cuffs, escaped to find out the world is going to end
an: i feel like we need to have a serious mature discussion
an: i feel like we were talking around it
an: how do you - how do - how do you feel ...... about  ..... this guy, right here
t: if we think about the last couple of months, you were ... kind of a dick
t: there were a lot of people who looked suspiciously like me
t: may before we talk about how I feel, we should talk about how _you_ feel
an: did i ever tell you about all the god stuff that happened with me
t: no ... cause that would've required you to have spoken to me
an: this doesnt excuse my awful behaviour, but when we got to the compound, i was in a way with my god, so i - i had a lot on my plate
an: and i profusely apologise for that
an: still not on great terms with the , the allfather, but we're getting better
t: why didn't you just talk to one of the others? cause they literally had to teach me to value myself again
a: if i had the emotional capacity, at the time, i wouldn't have done that, **i care about you too much**
an: end of the world and all that, i'm coming to grips with my incredibly awkward and intense and unconditional .... love, for you
t: what happens if the world doesn't end? what are you wanting? i do come as part of a package deal
a: i want to discuss it and figure it out
alanis: metamours are a thing!
t: is this something you would've said if the world wasn't ending
a: ive been thinking about this since i left the base
there's a moment pause
t: if we survive this, and the world doesn't end, we should explore this a little bit further, cause you're right, i still love you too

penny comes clean
about the betrayal and the purpose of siphoning people and infiltrating the group, etc
t: who taught you to do that?
p: conrad and bella, im p sure
c & b emotions - confused, don't remember that
ansel reads that as confusion not from not remembering, but because they don't have the knowledge of how to do that, nor did the demons figure out how to do it with the fight club mechanism
don't think the demons did it either?

everyone seperates out
al stacking pebbles on nyx's head
then goes to start booby trapping the place
asks lei whether the demons will appear in the sigil or through the demons

lei is face down in a pool of her own blood, stabbed in the back
al at her side, it's been more than a minute, an can't resurrect
taylor sees lei, eyes flare purple, runs out the building
damien in the corner, doing something w/ herbs, attempting to control his mutation, starts pink-red, now blue
ansel tries to get up
al: you can fix this, right?
an says nothing, yanks away to follow taylor
hear a guttural scream and explosion from outside
damien attempting to contact his patron (raven queen)
alanis fails mental health die, goes down to d6, looses mild control and shit nearby starts hovering an inch off the floor, tries to ask for divine sympathy (if lady luck could help persuade the raven queen)
nyx's eyes start flaring brightly, and form flickering between mutation

damien's eyes flare blue (al also sees this vision)
he's _pleading_ with the raven queen, but he's already sold his soul, and the RQ thinks we've been too lucky recently
lady luck turns up in a vision of gold: how about we play a game? if I win, Lei comes back, and Damien becomes one of mine. If I lose, Alanis becomes one of yours
lady luck pulls out a simple deck of cards - whoever pulls the highest wins
RQ : 4 / LL: Q
Damien glows with gold energy as his pact is transferred
Lei shimmers with that gold energy, then takes a gasping breath

outside, taylor is stood in an area of destruction, smaller than ansel expected, crater extending 5ft down
surrounded in a purple bubble of fire, but still purple fire erupting around her outside the bubble
ansel scoots on down, 3 dmg from the fire
puts hand on bubble, 19 dmg, and flung back, another 6 dmg
taylor looks up, ansel starts word-vomit apologising for being unable to save lei
al msgs: as always, luck was on our side, lei is fine
taylor jumps out the crater and runs back inside

penny gives supreme healing to nyx, taylor, damien, conrad, lei - ansel takes one
gives greater healing to nyx, bella, self, taylor, damien, self

sigil is extensively ruined
needs to be completely re-done
would take 4 hours solo, 1 1/2 with help

lei: i just felt pain, coldness, then nothing
probably the demons from the temple
they can get through small spaces easily

lei does the ritual
nyx and ansel on anti hover squad
alanis and achyls building booby traps - last one shoves ball bearings into cracks of the doors, but they run over the ritual area, adds an hour and a half to fix
half an hour too little

achyls phones dad, nat 20, he picks up
ach: where are you? 
dad: i'm trying to deal with a large situation
ach: funny you should say that, me too
dad: can it wait
ach: i know what you have, i need you to explain it to me, or so gd help me
dad: you and you alone can come to me and have this discussion
dad: meet me at the house

achyls and alanis head out to the house
rest head to the school (36 min left)

find out generator is in the base of the school
could be in basement, outbuildings, etc
demons were chilling the school, the generator could be holding the energy for the ritual
then what did we find in the church?
if generator is storing the excess energy, could use it to boost the bubble instead of powering the ritual

al uses greater invisibility
head into the house together
ach: where tf have u been
dad: dealing with the dark force going through town, why did you call me
ach: i think you know more than you're letting on
dad: achyls, did you get hit on the head? elaborate on what?

achyls goes up, tries to reveal something
dad: what are you doing?
achyls: what happened to mom, explain this mark, why did she leave? why are you connected to this, how?
he doesn't have a number above his head
ach: why do you have the mark of baphomet engraved into your skin?
dad: he's been my patron since i was a young boy, but doesn't mean i'm anything but a tool and doesn't mean i'm involved in any of this
ach: as far im concerned you're the reason mother left us
dad: some of us will die
ach: did he offer you immortality
dad: no, i was a young boy when he offered me
dad: but i'm trying to stop the demons running amok
ach: what did you sell your soul for?
dad: i recieved power and protection, and protection for loved ones
dad: she chose to leave, i chose to stay
dad: protection from harm, from individuals of darkness
dad: i knew penny's parents, friends since high school
so achy and penny were protected from harm
but was the one setting up the ritual to destroy the city that took his love from him
he teleports away
al tries counterspell
he counterspells backs

Start investigating the school
building feels like final boss fight is gonna happen soon
void of noise deeper in the earth - not sure if that's normal or because there's an absence of it

can't sense anything specific on the campus
the pressure on the glass itself is what cracks the bubble
there's no actual energy or magic signature - on the bubble or generator
detect magic would only work if you were right in front of it

al turns into a cheetah, achy on back, 15 min to school
hp: 32-2 = 30-4 =26

team 1 start sprinting through the school
can't see any disturbances
area by the gym that's giving a 'do not notice' vibe
where the pile of bodies during the fight was
Lando Dispel's Magic it

al and achy turn up
open the door
walk 15ft, before achy hits a ? invisble wall
similar to the one in the abyss - something has to be sacrificed to get through
exact nature - ?

benjy heads to front, pushes a diary through, there's a gold shimmer, then he's able to pass through
turns to us 'i think we have to give something up'

al tries to push through some fur
then a pen nyx just gave them

everyone pushes things through

another 15ft
another barrier - asking for blood
next barrier - A power / magic ability
next - knowledge
achy: i wrote lei's fate myself, but she defied it
lei uses her mutation, walks up to achy, achy crumbles to the floor

achy stood in an apartment (Damien's), lei lounging on a sofa
lei: i feel like we should have a chat
achy: i don't think that's necessary
lei: not necessary to kill me?
achy: that's not what i meant, all i wanted to do was delay the ritual! i was upset, betrayed!
lei: you felt betrayed so you betrayed someone else?
achy: it's easier when you don't know them. you're going to die anyway, what does it matter if it's done sooner?
lei: it matters to those who care about me. let me give you a crash course on who i am, cause maybe you won't stab me in the back with a poison dagger
achy crumples to the floor again, overwhelmed with lei's memories, of the team, of middlesborough, the underground, etc
it's extremely mentally painful
lei: do you have any remorse now? 
achy: how? you? so much pain, suffering, but so much love, happiness. how do you do it?
lei: I chose a family, or they choose me.  alanis is _very_ persistent in what they want. but i never let what _could_ happen dictate what i do. i never let what someone _else_ has done to me be a reason to hurt others. and you hurt my family by hurting me.
achy: my family hurt me, my friends hurt me, what is left for me but to watch the world burn?
lei: we were. and we would've succeeded. you were hurting, i understand, but now you've hurt others
achy: it's done, the clock has already ticked
lei: they have, but when we walk in there, we'll have to face the worse
achy: my father is working for baphomet! what can i do?
lei: you choose a side. if you don't, you'll stay trapped in this hell forever
achy: then i guess i'm a weapon in your hands
lei: i don't want a weapon, i wanted a friend
achy: so did i, once
lei: you can fix this, you've just got to give everyone a chance

lei puts their bracelet back on
walks through the barrier

damien's secret : the possession notebook, he was writing his proposal speech and planning all that out, and had been since before the attack, the rings were being made by ansel's parents and may not have been finished

everyone else, but taylor and achy are through
taylor: wtf dude. you were mad at penny for hurting ppl for the people they loved. you hurt us because ? 
achy: ive lost count of how many people i've tried to save

taylor: were the ball bearings on purpose
achy: my hand slipped
(lie), but penny and alanis don't catch

taylor: how do i know that you aren't just ... leading us into a trap? or working for your dad?
achy: because i want him dead, and you can help me
taylor: is that a recent development?
achy: ive had an inkling for a few weeks
taylor: after this is over, i'm coming after your ass

re the barrier
achy: after you, taytay
taylor blasts achy through
achy goes unconscious

taylor walks up to the barrier
t: my kill count ... it currently sits at 843, at the direction of hmwm, and i completely understand if that changes people's opinions of me, but i remember every single one of them

next one - sacrifice love
al - achy
achy - mother
ansel - al
nyx - yobi
penny - father
taylor - al
benjy - olly
polycule - taylor
twins - each other

Sidegame from a Tuesday game - set in the Bubble Pop universe
DM: Lauren
Jake: Mox  / Ash: Shadow / Vinnie: Jesse / Noah: Blank

There are three bubbles left
Aramore is ... deceptive - a seedy underbelly
Angelos - LA vibe, big city vibes

Teleported from where we were to a strange location - grey rooms with uniform tiles
looks like an interrogation room

blank wakes - genial smile
realises there's soundproofing in this room
sound under the door - boots coming past - patrols 
can't time them well - attention drawn to the mirror surface - 1 way mirror

jesse is cuffed by the horse legs 
Pulls out his cigar and takes a breather

mox - humanoid person in beat up modern clothes, wearing a beat up gas mask
picks their locks with a small knife in their sleeves
gets up to try the door, doesn't work
kicks the door, but no response
(the party all hear it)
dropkicks it, locking mechanism flies out, door slams open
hallway with multiple doors, opening to a breakroom with multiple guards within it

shadow wakes, unsurprised
acid splash on the handcuffs

mox was part of the rebellion on a city
was investigating these strange portals
was taken captive

open armoury - kill two men in suits w/ a thunderwave
both look very professional - now entirely dead
one still alive 
three guards come down the corridor
two immediately combust, last one is very disorientated
kill the last two (mox shot the last in the throat)

mox finds governmental credentials on the dead bodies
daniel o'mally and ?

shadow is Spooked by the elevator
we stealth up the stairs - higher than entrance level
10 floors of basemenet
25 floors above
office worker to more important

jesse: who are your folk?
mox: people who don't want to be oppressed

'i'm just fighting for my right to cameo'

top floor, glass windows floor to ceiling
perfect picket fence vibes in the town outside the window
5 doors, 3 on right to smaller offices, 2 at end to bigger rooms
ronald o'leery
paul robin
mendil kera
one is blank
cody Macintyre - head of the government

mox heads into cody's room
cody is behind the desk, working away, tall slender man with short black hair, blue suit that looks so dark its black
mox calls alanis
mox starts shooting
cody 'that's not a very nice thing to do is it. why don't you say hello before you walk in. why don't you take that spell of me, i'd rather not squish like a bug, i like to play with my food first'
blank 'who are you?'

mox shoots the window, shattering it
cody to blank 'i'd love to hunt you, but i've got to find a certain white haired lady first'
al pipes up from the phone 'gl motherfucker'
cody 'alanis is that you?'
al 'no, it's sinala'
cody 'make sure you survive what you're going through, cause i'd love for you to fight the boss first'
al 'why tf aren't you here to fight the real big boss'
code' no, baphomet will make us a lot of money first'

mox ties the rope on the arrow
grabs blank and jumps out the window
shoots the roof and tries to rappel down

swings down to the 19th floor
alarms going off
we get to the bottom floor, only 10 people above us
no-one in the lobby
we run out through the door

mox able to lead blank to the portal
then pushes blank through them
the portal closes, mox bugs out

nyx is engorging and their arm is vibrating

we're all starting to fuck off
ansel makes a fucking BAD DEAL
ansel turns, makes weird kissy noises, skunk spray, squirted bad vibes, FAILED
FUCKING
DIES

Everyone but Nyx, Anchy, Lei and Benjy dimension door out
nyx and penny share a look - penny _begging_ nyx to get out

everyone but achy is teleported out
achyls is teleporting out, 30ft at a time
something happens in the room, we don't know cause we all left

lando tries to rez ansel. its counterspelled? lando counterspells that, it works
out of nowhere, a thin green ray hits ansel and they die again, disintegrated

rand leaning against a nearby tree
steps forward to kill the rest, then stops
'its not fun when its not a challenge'
