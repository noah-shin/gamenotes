Downtime

In the main hall before assembly
	Ansel picking up excitement and sadness from Achy

Penny does a room vibe check:
- Ansel - bad, lot of death, lot of gods
- Nyx - Confused sadness
- Achy - not scared, it feels interesting
- Skylar - sad and guilty

Ansel is fully disconnected from their well of power
- now has a large scar through their stomach from Odin's spear

We all chat - Penny is told about their mission & about the underground

Allegedly a secret fifth level to the Underground - has a teleportation circle (don't know where it leads)
- one of the generals has to go first - to lead to the other side - the other has to stay behind
- civilians are evacuated first
- then general staff
- then the security
- vicky or ed would have to be the one to decide to cut off the evacuations
- those left behind were killed or taken to the government
vicky made that call during her call with ansel

plan - dress up as paladins for a night - grab our peace-bonded weapons, do stuff

we all head to assembly 
	its about the tournament - it was meant to be held in Wolffall
	the stormcoast institute (from fates hold) and angelwood conservatory (from angelos) turn up
	both groups are 12 ppl + teacher (storm coast teacher is a 'Valerie' (she/her), angelwood lead by 'Michael' (he/him) 
	stormcoast wearing neat military uniforms, angelwood wearing golden fancy uniforms
	the prize money will be 100 000 GP and a wish spell

Ansel starts a ritual need Yobi's grave
- with Skylar
- construct a temporary altar to commune, covered in a symbol of an eye (of Odin)

mediates, feels those tendrils of anger rise
- hears the sounds of fighting and banging on tables
- opens their eyes to see the halls of valahlla, everything covered in an ethereal glow
- ansel can tell they are not welcome but allowed entry
- there are 540 doors, one with Odin's name above it

ansel knocks, it opens
- has a conversation with him that we didn't hear
- the scar is gone and their magic is back
A : Where is Vicky?
- has a vision of Wakefield, a tall grey building
- not a pleasant experience

the symbol on the floor turns to stone
- their eye is now back as well

---

Nyx also went to Yobi's grave
- tries to deliberately induce Hulk state
- doesn't recognise Ansel
- - starts a fight
- - casts a necromantic spell
- - chokes ansel unconscious
- gets hit by 3 arrows and runs away, ansel in their grasp
- ansel casts Calm Emotions
- nyx hides in a tree, ansel points the paladins in another direction

someone gets a nat 20 perception check
sees the head of church of helm - a slender tall man with a dark blue suit
he's normally unnoticeable, eyes hidden behind sunglasses

Penny – spends it red threading connections between the people who died – x2 unconscious and x1 dead in the past two weeks — its sped up — cara and betti on same day (betty went missing the day before) —– they were together in the club —– Da was friends with Jackson (?)

-   dead people seem random-ish — not assigned to a group — top A ranks are dying — person dying coincides with paladins going missing
    
-   paladins going missing in a rotation? — every three weeks — random within the week
    
-   last taken 2 ½ weeks ago
    
-   no traces
    
-   along the same route — between the two underground connections
    
-   paladins don't have a family (renounced) (weakening connection to Helm)
    

Achlys – walks into VP Rand's office – convinces him to leave for a bit – finds the tournament itenirary — 1) dragon maze with riddles —– winner gets advs in the other tasks — 2) quiz — 3) battle between teams

-   teams from Darkpit are the Talons and us
-   from XXX – lightning coolers and stormbreaker – elemental magics
-   from XXX – chosen light and highfliers – celestial based
    
-   can find nothing from HM — rand seems to have all the power
    
-   hacks the comp — no name assigned to anything in 3 ½ years — Erun Crosshand —– cannot recall a matching face or even the name

-   nothing major coincided — other than turnover of teachers who retired — previous VP retired 5 years ago


Skylar – training telepathy and physical str — new and improved feat
