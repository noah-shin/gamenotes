[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.04 Game Notes s2/17. The Showdown\|17. The Showdown]] | [[18. \|18. ]]

Sidegame from a Tuesday game - set in the Bubble Pop universe
DM: Lauren
Jake: Mox  / Ash: Shadow / Vinnie: Jesse / Noah: Blank

There are three bubbles left
Aramore is ... deceptive - a seedy underbelly
Angelos - LA vibe, big city vibes

Teleported from where we were to a strange location - grey rooms with uniform tiles
looks like an interrogation room

blank wakes - genial smile
realises there's soundproofing in this room
sound under the door - boots coming past - patrols 
can't time them well - attention drawn to the mirror surface - 1 way mirror

jesse is cuffed by the horse legs 
Pulls out his cigar and takes a breather

mox - humanoid person in beat up modern clothes, wearing a beat up gas mask
picks their locks with a small knife in their sleeves
gets up to try the door, doesn't work
kicks the door, but no response
(the party all hear it)
dropkicks it, locking mechanism flies out, door slams open
hallway with multiple doors, opening to a breakroom with multiple guards within it

shadow wakes, unsurprised
acid splash on the handcuffs

mox was part of the rebellion on a city
was investigating these strange portals
was taken captive

open armoury - kill two men in suits w/ a thunderwave
both look very professional - now entirely dead
one still alive 
three guards come down the corridor
two immediately combust, last one is very disorientated
kill the last two (mox shot the last in the throat)

mox finds governmental credentials on the dead bodies
daniel o'mally and ?

shadow is Spooked by the elevator
we stealth up the stairs - higher than entrance level
10 floors of basemenet
25 floors above
office worker to more important

jesse: who are your folk?
mox: people who don't want to be oppressed

'i'm just fighting for my right to cameo'

top floor, glass windows floor to ceiling
perfect picket fence vibes in the town outside the window
5 doors, 3 on right to smaller offices, 2 at end to bigger rooms
ronald o'leery
paul robin
mendil kera
one is blank
cody Macintyre - head of the government

mox heads into cody's room
cody is behind the desk, working away, tall slender man with short black hair, blue suit that looks so dark its black
mox calls alanis
mox starts shooting
cody 'that's not a very nice thing to do is it. why don't you say hello before you walk in. why don't you take that spell of me, i'd rather not squish like a bug, i like to play with my food first'
blank 'who are you?'

mox shoots the window, shattering it
cody to blank 'i'd love to hunt you, but i've got to find a certain white haired lady first'
al pipes up from the phone 'gl motherfucker'
cody 'alanis is that you?'
al 'no, it's sinala'
cody 'make sure you survive what you're going through, cause i'd love for you to fight the boss first'
al 'why tf aren't you here to fight the real big boss'
code' no, baphomet will make us a lot of money first'

mox ties the rope on the arrow
grabs blank and jumps out the window
shoots the roof and tries to rappel down

swings down to the 19th floor
alarms going off
we get to the bottom floor, only 10 people above us
no-one in the lobby
we run out through the door

mox able to lead blank to the portal
then pushes blank through them
the portal closes, mox bugs out
