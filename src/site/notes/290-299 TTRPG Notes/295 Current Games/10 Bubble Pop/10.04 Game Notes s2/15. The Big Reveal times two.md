Arriving back at the warehouse
Walk in, it looks really different
Lei in process of drawing massive sigil on the floor

two teams push tay/ansel together
al bets damien 50gp and movie night that ansel fucks up
ansel walks up to t

after a minute, an: so......
t: we were all dead, i was dying, then the government, then torture, al got out of the cuffs, escaped to find out the world is going to end
an: i feel like we need to have a serious mature discussion
an: i feel like we were talking around it
an: how do you - how do - how do you feel ...... about  ..... this guy, right here
t: if we think about the last couple of months, you were ... kind of a dick
t: there were a lot of people who looked suspiciously like me
t: may before we talk about how I feel, we should talk about how _you_ feel
an: did i ever tell you about all the god stuff that happened with me
t: no ... cause that would've required you to have spoken to me
an: this doesnt excuse my awful behaviour, but when we got to the compound, i was in a way with my god, so i - i had a lot on my plate
an: and i profusely apologise for that
an: still not on great terms with the , the allfather, but we're getting better
t: why didn't you just talk to one of the others? cause they literally had to teach me to value myself again
a: if i had the emotional capacity, at the time, i wouldn't have done that, **i care about you too much**
an: end of the world and all that, i'm coming to grips with my incredibly awkward and intense and unconditional .... love, for you
t: what happens if the world doesn't end? what are you wanting? i do come as part of a package deal
a: i want to discuss it and figure it out
alanis: metamours are a thing!
t: is this something you would've said if the world wasn't ending
a: ive been thinking about this since i left the base
there's a moment pause
t: if we survive this, and the world doesn't end, we should explore this a little bit further, cause you're right, i still love you too

penny comes clean
about the betrayal and the purpose of siphoning people and infiltrating the group, etc
t: who taught you to do that?
p: conrad and bella, im p sure
c & b emotions - confused, don't remember that
ansel reads that as confusion not from not remembering, but because they don't have the knowledge of how to do that, nor did the demons figure out how to do it with the fight club mechanism
don't think the demons did it either?

everyone seperates out
al stacking pebbles on nyx's head
then goes to start booby trapping the place
asks lei whether the demons will appear in the sigil or through the demons

lei is face down in a pool of her own blood, stabbed in the back
al at her side, it's been more than a minute, an can't resurrect
taylor sees lei, eyes flare purple, runs out the building
damien in the corner, doing something w/ herbs, attempting to control his mutation, starts pink-red, now blue
ansel tries to get up
al: you can fix this, right?
an says nothing, yanks away to follow taylor
hear a guttural scream and explosion from outside
damien attempting to contact his patron (raven queen)
alanis fails mental health die, goes down to d6, looses mild control and shit nearby starts hovering an inch off the floor, tries to ask for divine sympathy (if lady luck could help persuade the raven queen)
nyx's eyes start flaring brightly, and form flickering between mutation

damien's eyes flare blue (al also sees this vision)
he's _pleading_ with the raven queen, but he's already sold his soul, and the RQ thinks we've been too lucky recently
lady luck turns up in a vision of gold: how about we play a game? if I win, Lei comes back, and Damien becomes one of mine. If I lose, Alanis becomes one of yours
lady luck pulls out a simple deck of cards - whoever pulls the highest wins
RQ : 4 / LL: Q
Damien glows with gold energy as his pact is transferred
Lei shimmers with that gold energy, then takes a gasping breath

outside, taylor is stood in an area of destruction, smaller than ansel expected, crater extending 5ft down
surrounded in a purple bubble of fire, but still purple fire erupting around her outside the bubble
ansel scoots on down, 3 dmg from the fire
puts hand on bubble, 19 dmg, and flung back, another 6 dmg
taylor looks up, ansel starts word-vomit apologising for being unable to save lei
al msgs: as always, luck was on our side, lei is fine
taylor jumps out the crater and runs back inside

penny gives supreme healing to nyx, taylor, damien, conrad, lei - ansel takes one
gives greater healing to nyx, bella, self, taylor, damien, self

sigil is extensively ruined
needs to be completely re-done
would take 4 hours solo, 1 1/2 with help

lei: i just felt pain, coldness, then nothing
probably the demons from the temple
they can get through small spaces easily

lei does the ritual
nyx and ansel on anti hover squad
alanis and achyls building booby traps - last one shoves ball bearings into cracks of the doors, but they run over the ritual area, adds an hour and a half to fix
half an hour too little

achyls phones dad, nat 20, he picks up
ach: where are you? 
dad: i'm trying to deal with a large situation
ach: funny you should say that, me too
dad: can it wait
ach: i know what you have, i need you to explain it to me, or so gd help me
dad: you and you alone can come to me and have this discussion
dad: meet me at the house

achyls and alanis head out to the house
rest head to the school (36 min left)

find out generator is in the base of the school
could be in basement, outbuildings, etc
demons were chilling the school, the generator could be holding the energy for the ritual
then what did we find in the church?
if generator is storing the excess energy, could use it to boost the bubble instead of powering the ritual

al uses greater invisibility
head into the house together
ach: where tf have u been
dad: dealing with the dark force going through town, why did you call me
ach: i think you know more than you're letting on
dad: achyls, did you get hit on the head? elaborate on what?

achyls goes up, tries to reveal something
dad: what are you doing?
achyls: what happened to mom, explain this mark, why did she leave? why are you connected to this, how?
he doesn't have a number above his head
ach: why do you have the mark of baphomet engraved into your skin?
dad: he's been my patron since i was a young boy, but doesn't mean i'm anything but a tool and doesn't mean i'm involved in any of this
ach: as far im concerned you're the reason mother left us
dad: some of us will die
ach: did he offer you immortality
dad: no, i was a young boy when he offered me
dad: but i'm trying to stop the demons running amok
ach: what did you sell your soul for?
dad: i recieved power and protection, and protection for loved ones
dad: she chose to leave, i chose to stay
dad: protection from harm, from individuals of darkness
dad: i knew penny's parents, friends since high school
so achy and penny were protected from harm
but was the one setting up the ritual to destroy the city that took his love from him
he teleports away
al tries counterspell
he counterspells backs
