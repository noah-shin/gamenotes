## 29/09/2023

Elerra checks for traps - nothing in the area
Divine sense - nothing in the room, vague ping of undead from the bread shop

Sable steps in, his glasses fog up immediately
Odessa closes the door, preventing it from locking w/ a hammer on the floor

Odessa starts going through the toys on the shelf - nothing unusual
Sable swings open the door to the right
	Its a sizeable workshop, four large benches with half carved toys & plans
	There are steeped small piles of snow in weird spots of the room

Odessa kicks at one of the snow drifts - appears fresh and frozen but normal
Sable checks the blueprints for reference to the runes
	No mention of it

Odessa opens the door to the left
	Opens to a storage room - rows of wooden shelves
	Sable melts some of the snow

Elerra stealthily opens the main door
	Long stone room, floor splattered with old blood and piles of snow
	Three large wooden tables stacked with various weapons on the left
	To the right, a spiral staircase leading up, and a desk with a large thin book

Book is in Elvish
	Looks like a training schedule
	And notes on various people - eg progression, need for improvement, etc
	Elerra recognises some of them as the Lightflower boys
	20 - 30 being trained
	Hands it over to Sable

Odessa checks over the weapons
	Can tell all have been handmade
	As though they belonged to specific people
	And the table looks like its been scavenged and half-empty
	A battleaxe has the rune on the grip

Head towards the stairs
	Hear an absence of everything from up the stairs
	There are two floors

Next floor is a square stone room with two closed doors
	Elerra speaks down to Odessa : what was your opinion on leashes again?
	Odessa hears barely a whisper - definitely quieter than before
	Odessa whispers back : they're useful
	Also quieter for Elerra
	Elerra : agree on that point, they have their uses. there's something muffling the sound between floors, but its clear to come up

Noise is damped across the entire floor

Odessa opens the door on the left
	Kitchen and break room
	Rug surrounded by tables infront of a recently stamped out fireplace
		Frantically ended
		Was stamped out ~ 7 1/2 hours ago
	Window along the south wall, next to another door
		Frosted over, looks over Shelith Market, in the housing cluster, not the shopping district
		Time seems to have passed faster than it should've
		Been about six hours

Door next to the window leads to the city - one of the streets in the housing cluster

Door to the left leads to a dormitory - military / orphanage esque
	Beds are labelled - same as the book

Another door leads to the toliet

Odessa immediately heads up the stairs
Elerra goes first and convinces the group to go quiet

There is major noise dampening up here - have to shout to be heard

A waiting room with a single, more ornate door
	Odessa swings it open, revealing a large workshop
	Large desk at the other end, with an unusually large chair behind it
	And behind that are five stones floating in a glass and stone display case, engraved with the rune
		One is glowing
	And four people - more Lightflowers
	A door behind the desk that is immediately closed, with a flash of a red coat

Odessa sprints across the entire room
Elerra shoots one and immediately murks him
Elerra desiccates another one

Odessa yanks open the door
	Reveals a bedroom
	Tiny is sucked up the top of the chimney, laughing
She curses, and turns to rummage through the desk
	similar to the store - letters between Tiny and Rinna Feythril
	older letters, and describing the refugees
	vague mention of how Rinna has taken over an orphanage in Tiny's name, in Fil'ran

Sable magic missiles kills the other two

Sable takes the boots off the orphan stuck to the wall

Elerra investigates the chest - only a slim opening in the back, no other hinge or opening
Odessa looks at the bookcases - books, files, and some ice sculptures
	There's a small ice bowl full of wind-up keys

Odessa also asks after Rinna
	Elerra knows that the nearest settlement on the surface is Filran, and Feythril is a big deal up there
	She's been nearby, just to visit
	And is aware that Filran has repeatedly been hit by the Blooding
	Not heard of anyone specifically from Feythril, but a death of anyone is felt like a family member

Elerra asks after the Blooding
	Seems vaguely horrified
	Odessa explains : It's part of our function to prove strength, the weak don't get to survive.

Turn to look over at Sable opening a kid's skull to check if there are mushrooms in there
	Elerra is horrified
	The brain is freezing cold
	No spores

Elerra goes through the bowl of keys
	There's a final key _in_ the bowl
	She shapes water to get the key to emerge
Winds up the box, and can hear gears shifting
	The top pops off
	Inside is a big tome, and a scattering of papers
		Same handwriting as the training book
		A ring with a sigil
		A platinum necklace with a vial of clear liquid
		And more stones like the display cases, but without a carving

Elerra takes the ring
Odessa takes the necklace
	Feels like it a concentrated essence of sadness within the pendant
Sable goes through the tome
	Written in Sylvan - something a little older as well
	And about a type of magic that he doesn't recognise - runic ?
	Very specific to the rune we've been encountering
Elerra goes through the papers
	Also in Sylvan
	Also about the ice rune
	Also see a paper on a spell called 'Dispel Rune'
	It's a translation from the tome

Elerra thinks the stone in the other room is a central hub for the power
Sable goes to cast the spell scroll on the rune
He asks Odessa and Elerra to turn around
	Then the light flows from the stone up his arm, glowing under his skin, like scalpels trying to escape
	Before the light reaches his eyes, glowing a bright blue, then teal, then fading
