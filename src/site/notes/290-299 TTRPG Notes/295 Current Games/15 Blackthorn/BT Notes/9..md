Sage flies up to get a lay of the land with her cool emerald wings, getting us safely past Zripton City.

Nikitih helps lifts the cart over areas of difficult terrain, fully bypassing them.

Jackie gets Jasper to scout ahead

Rudy works with the cows to get them to stay strong

Silk does a performance in a nearby town with Jackie - Shakespeare in the park, feat fire breathing cat

We choose our team name - king wizard and the lizard kings

Whitecliff is built on a natural sea harbour, a beautiful picturesque town, though weirdly quiet right now.

We head to the Mayor's house - red carpet down marble stairs out the front entrance
Guy in a very red suit - butler - warns us to be on our 'best behaviour'
Immaculate and expensive looking building, red roses and gold accents, 

reach the office, lit with candlelight
mayor - high elf with long red hair and piercing eyes, pockmarked silver-hued skin
- Avarelle Femorah

noises - forest, butchers, bakers, herbalist, graveyard, and around town - at the top of the town
disappearances from around town
- 4 members of the church in the graveyard
-  - all around 25 years old, dragonborn, elf, dwarf, gnome
- the baker
- the butcher's daughter (was going to get married shortly)
- 3 fisherman (permeant bachelor)
- herbalist's assistant 

he doesn't believe in the church - but the town are very set on it
he also doesn't actually wanna be here / be the mayor / care about these appearances
been the mayor for 60 years - since he got here and previous mayor died and no-one else wanted to role

---

We head to the church of Umberlee
- the reason the town is quiet is cause everyone is in the sermon
- sermon is that the issues are umberlee's wish and we've just got to appease her

---

Poker game in the grass while waiting for the sermon to be over
silk and jackie w/ nat 1s (silk taught jackie the wrong rules)
nikitih pulls a win!

---

head into the church
rudy - we've been sent from blackthorn!
priest - who hired you? we're perfectly good as is, we don't need you
rudy - client privilege 

he's a very Staunch and Stubborn guy
- we shouldn't be interfering with umberlee's affairs 

noises - thumping, then something on the wind like whimpering and groaning

silk tries to get in an argument with this guy about why he's wrong
gets dragged away

---

head to the tavern, as its now filling up
grab our rooms for the night - getting 3 between us
and rudy gets us a round of drinks, and we settle in to begin our investigations and questions here
