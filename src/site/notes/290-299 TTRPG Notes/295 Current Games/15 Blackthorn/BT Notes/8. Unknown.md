no extra info, just need to head over there

we head to joanne's
nice and small, hidden between other stores, red brick shop next to a giant monolith blue crystal
chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, regular witch shop with bundles of herbs and crystals everywhere, locked box by cash register
shop keeper behind a magic beaded curtain working on stuff

she comes out, has a lenticular name-plate with 'joanne' and 'jo'
has sparkling red eyes, cropped hair, short (4' 10)
sage and rudy notice a small red cross on the wrist, with two smaller red crosses to the sides
