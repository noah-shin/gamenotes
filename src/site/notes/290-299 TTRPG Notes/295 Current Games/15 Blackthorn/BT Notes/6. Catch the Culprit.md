Thoughts: The angels became the costumes?
Basil turns up

Crowd had gone to front door
Dompins went opposite
One person went towards the Library? - don't recognise outfit from the list
So wasn't on the list - cause we ticked everyone off
Snuck in?
Was wearing stereotypical wizard outfit, humanoid, between 3 and 6ft tall, light blue cyan skin, 

Silk takes a sample of the poisoned (maybe) drinks
We all head towards the Library - aka the second floor
stealth in

nikiti and rudy here muttering from higher levels
rudy doesn't recognise the language
nikiti vaguely recognises it, but not abyssal - family to Primodial (either family or is)
sense that it is being chanted

nikiti throws silk up (vinnie: always knew nikiti was a tosser)
jackie misty steps
rudy flies alongside silk, unconsciously showing off, going 'you are under arrest'

we all see a male triton, long white hair, black eyes, regal face
one of the diplomats - Khinnis Uhrolvath - the Gold Dragon
was a late addition to the list
member of the Council for this town - opposes Dompin's policies
they _are_ chanting Primordial

he sidesteps my cannonball
jackie fails hold person
silk bodies him down and shoves a hand over his mouth
then shoves the wizard hat into his mouth when he keeps muttering

nikiti rises up onto tip of tail from below
rudy finishes the arrest

take the hat out
khinnis : do you know who i am?
basil: you're in an area you shouldn't be in here, with suspicious chanting

basil figures out he wasn't invited
but was on the list?
wasn't fearing for his life
never met the lady of the house here

we gave all invites back to the people
khinnis never actually turned up - even though it was weird for a fellow Council member to not turn up

feel residual magic in the air - but he isn't illusioned
jackie finds a spellbook - written in an unknown language
starts casting comprehend languages

refuses to acknowledge that he was casting a spell
nikiti intimidates the shit out of him
silk lays sword on his neck

khinnis: came in through the basement, cellar door
kh: these are some of the most restricted texts and intimate council knowledge in this city, wanted to have some of it stolen while the party was attacked so dompin would take the fall and get kicked off the council
kh: the magic was to turn costumes into actual monsters
kh: i thought it was time to get kicked off the council by losing important documents and failing to protect the party
kh: i was working alone (truth - at this point in time)
kh: i was bored, and thought i wouldn't get caught

jackie finishes the comprehend language spell
reads the spellbook (was in Primordial)
v v old

we march him to the office
more private security outside the office
dompin turns up
khinnis turns to bluff, nikiti pushes a pressure point, he tries to wiggle out
dompin rehashes the interrogation, gets the full story

we completed our job satisfactorily!
will get paid
dompin: thank you for your services tonight
