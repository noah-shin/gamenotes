Sage - been working with the Dompin's for a while
but heading back to blackthorn to see if she can help out more there

dompin is fond of her, but glad to see sage go forward

sage casts cure wounds on silk

get back to the guild
full house, everyone 
head of guild behind the bar
silk and rudy head over
sage nervously asking endless questions to nikiti
s and r bring over the other three - all go to the back office

we sit around the room
get paid - 350 GP each
give the report - hashtag we all lived, and completed the mission
sage introduces herself - sage gulliver
rholl recognises the name, vaguely surprised - nikiti and sage see it
silk remembers giving some of those hero medals (platinum heart) to someone with that same last name

blackthorn protects its members
such as those who found the law not on the side of good action
in past, a changeling has submitted not their real name

we need to submit a name
and a team name
and a basic will
and where we want to get the guild tattoo

tattoo works on scale and fur
silk: does it work for those who ... change shape
we all promise to keep a secret
rholl leans forward, changes shape into a high elf, then back

long rest

next day
sage's best memory - foraging with parents for stuff for tonics in the woods, then cooked them all together, and talking about the healing properties
sage: it's always good to cherish those memories when you've lost somebody, isn't it
parents are rowan and river
sage: i miss them everyday
