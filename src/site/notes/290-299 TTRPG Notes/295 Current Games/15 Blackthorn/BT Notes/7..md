Sage - been working with the Dompin's for a while
but heading back to blackthorn to see if she can help out more there

dompin is fond of her, but glad to see sage go forward

sage casts cure wounds on silk

get back to the guild
full house, everyone 
head of guild behind the bar
silk and rudy head over
sage nervously asking endless questions to nikiti
s and r bring over the other three - all go to the back office

we sit around the room
get paid - 350 GP each
give the report - hashtag we all lived, and completed the mission
sage introduces herself - sage gulliver
rholl recognises the name, vaguely surprised - nikiti and sage see it
silk remembers giving some of those hero medals (platinum heart) to someone with that same last name

blackthorn protects its members
such as those who found the law not on the side of good action
in past, a changeling has submitted not their real name

we need to submit a name
and a team name
and a basic will
and where we want to get the guild tattoo

tattoo works on scale and fur
silk: does it work for those who ... change shape
we all promise to keep a secret
rholl leans forward, changes shape into a high elf, then back

long rest

next day
sage's best memory - foraging with parents for stuff for tonics in the woods, then cooked them all together, and talking about the healing properties
sage: it's always good to cherish those memories when you've lost somebody, isn't it
parents are rowan and river
sage: i miss them everyday
sage: one day, found out they were no longer here, and was never given any details

sage sneaks off to the office - successfully
[only sage knows]
she wants two tattoos - to honour them
gets one now, in secret, on right bicep
rholl is unsurprised she wants to ask questions later about them

silk also sneaks in - fails to sneak to everyone but nikiti
wonders if the tattoo does a cover up - aka the one on his chest
nope, cause the magic may have intwined with their soul
but the mages here can maybe try to figure it out later

rudy also sneaks in - only silk doesn't realise
asks for the potential of a mentorship
though most other teams are busy
everyone is happen to chat while they're here

nikiti also sneaks in - everyone realises
nikiti: hows my son. does he have any bullies yet?
rholl: it's _creche_. no, theyre good. they're all a little weird at that age
nikiti: do you know who we are? are they coming for us??
rholl: i've seen the bulletins. but they're all more pre-occupied with the bombing in the capitol
nikiti susses that rholl _is_ a dad, but it's complicated? maybe of someone now fully an adult?
nikiti has a bounty, amongst the royal guard, for 20k gold
nikiti: any gossip? from one parent to maybe another
rholl doesn't acknowledge the parent comment
rholl: we do have a network, but we protect are our own
rholl: we can't make the bulletin go away completely, but we can stop the other guilds from acting on it
nikiti: are yall a cult? asking for a friend, i wouldn't want to join another one
rholl: 120 and 55 years ago, had an issue of people pretending to be blackthorn members
r: you can get the tattoos removed if you want

all head in together
sage gives real name
silk is silk smith
rudy is quentin waterback
nikiti is nick slithers

silk gets tat on back of right shoulder
nikiti gets it on back of neck
rudy gets it on left bicep
sage gets it on back of hand
