Silk dies\|5. Silk dies]] >>

Ash: Sage - emerald dragonborn, draped in white and gold scarves, confident but young, many pockets and pouches, herbalist stuff, very comforting presence.

Talking to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/15 Blackthorn/BT Wiki/NPCs/Morgantha\|Morgantha]] - wearing a large glittery crown and ornate gown (going as one of the Queens from Disney)

We arrive at the house
Mr Demontford IV leads up to ballroom - white and gold ballroom, massive red curtains, giant picture of family at one end of hall

Meet Sage
_they are the wellness tent coach_

Head to front door, set up
Morgantha turns up - must be who they are, and good costumes (only royalty let in without a costume)
No approved press
Most ppl coming having magic weapons

Ball starts
lmao we have nothing to determine who they are (jessssss)
Mithseis Ozdemir (Cowboy) &  Rihala Sahin (Cowboy)
Hamfo Banksi    Fairy Prince of court &  Camellia Banksi    Fairy Princess
Thymeros Samm    Centaur as a centaur

Throughout the night, we let in 16 people, some people turned away (bad costumes, trying to fake their id, etc)
NAT 20 FOR BOTH INSIGHT AND PERCEPTION

Surprise guest - tall figure walking up the drive, dressed as a roman gladiator, royal crest on his bicep
rudy trips and face plants, silk pulls Jackie into a bow, he ignore us and heads straight inside.

then hesitates over closing the door
S to R: how much does blackthorn mean to you? do we want to be trapped in here with _him_?
Jasper follows him through, now on the prince's shoulder

Silk and Jackie post up next to doors inside ballroom
N posted up outside
R head to medic tent

Sage ambushes R in the quiet room
R shares that someone's arrived that isn't a fan of them
Sage tries give them some helpful makeup to obfuscate their identity

Silk feels familiar watching the ballroom
Loud meow -  Prince now next to me, putting cat on the ground. 
P: 'I think this cat, it belongs to your friend'
Si: This is better than anything from 'home'
Something flutters past his face I can't recognise
P: At least you have the luxury of leaving
he leaves
silk follows him 
he whirls around : freedom is a luxury few afford. you have escaped your little cage, enjoying things, you look better like this than as him
-> fully telling the truth
silk : say hi to the parents for me
he scoffs, lightly, almost at the idea of talking to his parents, or at the idea of me claiming thing as my parents

Jackie in ballroom, watches group of three angels by drinks table start gasping in pain, before turning to stone.

N by the front door
Prince walks past

why is P here? 
all royalty is invited to everything, sometimes turn up (its kinda random)
usually with security - odd that he's alone

(silk overhearing)
N: Prince Farron, it's a surprise, you're very far from home
P: Nikiti, good evening. Interesting ... company you're keeping. 
N: I'll cut to the chase. Have you come here for us?
P: You're not an idiot, if I was here for you, I'd be with a legion of men and you wouldn't be leaving the premises alive
N: Why are you here then? It's awfully ... coincidental
P is very hesitant to answer
P: You have your secrets, I have mine. But don't worry, I won't be informing anyone of where you are
N: Why not?
P: I have my business, you have yours
P is trying not to give N info, cause doesn't know what N would do with that info
Most nervous N has ever seen him - other than once before during a hushed convo between N's wife and him before everything went down (Wife: everything will be fine! Prince: No it won't)
P walks up to N, whispers in their ear: Keep him out of trouble, would you?
P walks away down the driveway, hops the fence into the woods, start running

****

From the ballroom, screams start sounding, three angels turning to stone
They fall to their knees, scream abruptly cut off as they start snarling
Pablo Bislimi - Deathpact Angel  
Cohnal Briarbosk - Weeping angel  
Soliania Briarbosk - Weeping angel

Initiative
Jackie hides in a corner
7 ppl run out
Silk takes _31 points of dmg_
N heads to the one fighting J - deals a _shiton_ of dmg
Sage summons spiritual weapon - it's a group of ppl (therapist, nail artist, etc)
Sage figures out that staring at them will stop them from moving
J destroys the angel (flash of yellow magic, smacks it, and it shatters)
One of the stone pieces has a blinking eye, before it just ... stops

silk takes goes DOWN
one hit - 2 failed death saves
jasper the cat comes over and paws at silk's now changeling prone body
second hit - permadead
jackie has a memory thing?
jasper freezes, then climbs onto silk's chest, nudging at his head, before speaking in a voice none of us have heard before
Jasper: Ars, Ars, you need to come back now. It's time for you to come back, I wasn't done playing
gold glow from jasper's paws
Jasper: I guess Ars, you're going to come back now. I have to go, just for a while, but you have to look after her.
Then Jasper disappears in a glow of gold
Jackie hears a little whisper from Jasper: I led you home. But I'll be back, otherwise I'll miss playing with my friends

****

Whilst dead - secret talk!
Feel myself back in my og form
Feel something pawing at me, reaching into my soul
I can see the cat, as the kitten, sat there - the floor is water and the days are passing quickly overhead
S: You're not Jackie, are you?
J: No, but they were a bright light or asked me to look after someone
S: Who are you?
J: That's a story for another day
J: Bringing you back, that's noticeable to other's like myself
J: That was no regular poison in drinks, that was powerful magic, someone with a grudge
J: The prince spent most of his time being smitten with someone
J: I think the feeling is mutual
J: I wouldn't worry about it to much, he won't let himself, or he won't be allowed to have it
J: She lost all of her memory immediately, then lost it again right before meeting you. 
J: My own siblings are calling, I have to go.
J: Peace out, may the light be with you

****

Sage and N both notice that the spiritual weapon and glaive is glowing gold
Plus extra secretssss

N kills second angel
Silk takes down the last, cleaving it in half

Combat ends

Silk panics, goes through a bunch of their faces
Sage comes by, casts Calm Emotions, Silk calms down and settles into his normal face
Sage recognises the Prince Atala face

Silk: That was a cool cat, wasn't it?
