Ash: Sage - emerald dragonborn, draped in white and gold scarves, confident but young, many pockets and pouches, herbalist stuff, very comforting presence.

Talking to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/15 Blackthorn/BT Wiki/NPCs/Morgantha\|Morgantha]] - wearing a large glittery crown and ornate gown (going as one of the Queens from Disney)

We arrive at the house
Mr Demontford IV leads up to ballroom - white and gold ballroom, massive red curtains, giant picture of family at one end of hall

Meet Sage
_they are the wellness tent coach_

Head to front door, set up
Morgantha turns up - must be who they are, and good costumes (only royalty let in without a costume)
No approved press
Most ppl coming having magic weapons

Ball starts
lmao we have nothing to determine who they are (jessssss)
Mithseis Ozdemir (Cowboy) &  Rihala Sahin (Cowboy)
Hamfo Banksi    Fairy Prince of court &  Camellia Banksi    Fairy Princess
Thymeros Samm    Centaur as a centaur

Throughout the night, we let in 16 people, some people turned away (bad costumes, trying to fake their id, etc)
NAT 20 FOR BOTH INSIGHT AND PERCEPTION

Surprise guest - tall figure walking up the drive, dressed as a roman gladiator, royal crest on his bicep
rudy trips and face plants, silk pulls Jackie into a bow, he ignore us and heads straight inside.

then hesitates over closing the door
S to R: how much does blackthorn mean to you? do we want to be trapped in here with _him_?
Jasper follows him through, now on the prince's shoulder

Silk and Jackie post up next to doors inside ballroom
N posted up outside
R head to medic tent

Sage ambushes R in the quiet room
R shares that someone's arrived that isn't a fan of them
Sage tries give them some helpful makeup to obfuscate their identity

Silk feels familiar watching the ballroom
Loud meow -  Prince now next to me, putting cat on the ground. 
P: 'I think this cat, it belongs to your friend'
Si: This is better than anything from 'home'
Something flutters past his face I can't recognise
P: At least you have the luxury of leaving
he leaves
silk follows him 
he whirls around : freedom is a luxury few afford. you have escaped your little cage, enjoying things, you look better like this than as him
-> fully telling the truth
silk : say hi to the parents for me
he scoffs, lightly, almost at the idea of talking to his parents, or at the idea of me claiming thing as my parents

Jackie in ballroom, watches group of three angels by drinks table start gasping in pain, before turning to stone.

N by the front door
Prince walks past

why is P here? 
all royalty is invited to everything, sometimes turn up (its kinda random)
usually with security - odd that he's alone

(silk overhearing)
N: Prince Farron, it's a surprise, you're very far from home
P: Nikiti, good evening. Interesting ... company you're keeping. 
N: I'll cut to the chase. Have you come here for us?
P: You're not an idiot, if I was here for you, I'd be with a legion of men and you wouldn't be leaving the premises alive
N: Why are you here then? It's awfully ... coincidental
P is very hesitant to answer
P: You have your secrets, I have mine. But don't worry, I won't be informing anyone of where you are
N: Why not?
P: I have my business, you have yours
P is trying not to give N info, cause doesn't know what N would do with that info
Most nervous N has ever seen him - other than once before during a hushed convo between N's wife and him before everything went down (Wife: everything will be fine! Prince: No it won't)
P walks up to N, whispers in their ear: Keep him out of trouble, would you?
P walks away down the driveway, hops the fence into the woods, start running

****

From the ballroom, screams start sounding, three angels turning to stone
They fall to their knees, scream abruptly cut off as they start snarling
Pablo Bislimi - Deathpact Angel  
Cohnal Briarbosk - Weeping angel  
Soliania Briarbosk - Weeping angel

Initiative
Jackie hides in a corner
7 ppl run out
Silk takes _31 points of dmg_
N heads to the one fighting J - deals a _shiton_ of dmg
Sage summons spiritual weapon - it's a group of ppl (therapist, nail artist, etc)
Sage figures out that staring at them will stop them from moving
J destroys the angel (flash of yellow magic, smacks it, and it shatters)
One of the stone pieces has a blinking eye, before it just ... stops

silk takes goes DOWN
one hit - 2 failed death saves
jasper the cat comes over and paws at silk's now changeling prone body
second hit - permadead
jackie has a memory thing?
jasper freezes, then climbs onto silk's chest, nudging at his head, before speaking in a voice none of us have heard before
Jasper: Ars, Ars, you need to come back now. It's time for you to come back, I wasn't done playing
gold glow from jasper's paws
Jasper: I guess Ars, you're going to come back now. I have to go, just for a while, but you have to look after her.
Then Jasper disappears in a glow of gold
Jackie hears a little whisper from Jasper: I led you home. But I'll be back, otherwise I'll miss playing with my friends

****

Whilst dead - secret talk!
Feel myself back in my og form
Feel something pawing at me, reaching into my soul
I can see the cat, as the kitten, sat there - the floor is water and the days are passing quickly overhead
S: You're not Jackie, are you?
J: No, but they were a bright light or asked me to look after someone
S: Who are you?
J: That's a story for another day
J: Bringing you back, that's noticeable to other's like myself
J: That was no regular poison in drinks, that was powerful magic, someone with a grudge
J: The prince spent most of his time being smitten with someone
J: I think the feeling is mutual
J: I wouldn't worry about it to much, he won't let himself, or he won't be allowed to have it
J: She lost all of her memory immediately, then lost it again right before meeting you. 
J: My own siblings are calling, I have to go.
J: Peace out, may the light be with you

****

Sage and N both notice that the spiritual weapon and glaive is glowing gold
Plus extra secretssss

N kills second angel
Silk takes down the last, cleaving it in half

Combat ends

Silk panics, goes through a bunch of their faces
Sage comes by, casts Calm Emotions, Silk calms down and settles into his normal face
Sage recognises the Prince Atala face

Silk: That was a cool cat, wasn't it?

Thoughts: The angels became the costumes?
Rudy turns up

Crowd had gone to front door
Dompins went opposite
One person went towards the Library? - don't recognise outfit from the list
So wasn't on the list - cause we ticked everyone off
Snuck in?
Was wearing stereotypical wizard outfit, humanoid, between 3 and 6ft tall, light blue cyan skin, 

Silk takes a sample of the poisoned (maybe) drinks
We all head towards the Library - aka the second floor
stealth in

nikiti and rudy here muttering from higher levels
rudy doesn't recognise the language
nikiti vaguely recognises it, but not abyssal - family to Primodial (either family or is)
sense that it is being chanted

nikiti throws silk up (vinnie: always knew nikiti was a tosser)
jackie misty steps
rudy flies alongside silk, unconsciously showing off, going 'you are under arrest'

we all see a male triton, long white hair, black eyes, regal face
one of the diplomats - Khinnis Uhrolvath - the Gold Dragon
was a late addition to the list
member of the Council for this town - opposes Dompin's policies
they _are_ chanting Primordial

he sidesteps my cannonball
jackie fails hold person
silk bodies him down and shoves a hand over his mouth
then shoves the wizard hat into his mouth when he keeps muttering

nikiti rises up onto tip of tail from below
rudy finishes the arrest

take the hat out
khinnis : do you know who i am?
rudy: you're in an area you shouldn't be in here, with suspicious chanting

rudy figures out he wasn't invited
but was on the list?
wasn't fearing for his life
never met the lady of the house here

we gave all invites back to the people
khinnis never actually turned up - even though it was weird for a fellow Council member to not turn up

feel residual magic in the air - but he isn't illusioned
jackie finds a spellbook - written in an unknown language
starts casting comprehend languages

refuses to acknowledge that he was casting a spell
nikiti intimidates the shit out of him
silk lays sword on his neck

khinnis: came in through the basement, cellar door
kh: these are some of the most restricted texts and intimate council knowledge in this city, wanted to have some of it stolen while the party was attacked so dompin would take the fall and get kicked off the council
kh: the magic was to turn costumes into actual monsters
kh: i thought it was time to get kicked off the council by losing important documents and failing to protect the party
kh: i was working alone (truth - at this point in time)
kh: i was bored, and thought i wouldn't get caught

jackie finishes the comprehend language spell
reads the spellbook (was in Primordial)
v v old

we march him to the office
more private security outside the office
dompin turns up
khinnis turns to bluff, nikiti pushes a pressure point, he tries to wiggle out
dompin rehashes the interrogation, gets the full story

we completed our job satisfactorily!
will get paid
dompin: thank you for your services tonight

Sage - been working with the Dompin's for a while
but heading back to blackthorn to see if she can help out more there

dompin is fond of her, but glad to see sage go forward

sage casts cure wounds on silk

get back to the guild
full house, everyone 
head of guild behind the bar
silk and rudy head over
sage nervously asking endless questions to nikiti
s and r bring over the other three - all go to the back office

we sit around the room
get paid - 350 GP each
give the report - hashtag we all lived, and completed the mission
sage introduces herself - sage gulliver
rholl recognises the name, vaguely surprised - nikiti and sage see it
silk remembers giving some of those hero medals (platinum heart) to someone with that same last name

blackthorn protects its members
such as those who found the law not on the side of good action
in past, a changeling has submitted not their real name

we need to submit a name
and a team name
and a basic will
and where we want to get the guild tattoo

tattoo works on scale and fur
silk: does it work for those who ... change shape
we all promise to keep a secret
rholl leans forward, changes shape into a high elf, then back

long rest

next day
sage's best memory - foraging with parents for stuff for tonics in the woods, then cooked them all together, and talking about the healing properties
sage: it's always good to cherish those memories when you've lost somebody, isn't it
parents are rowan and river
sage: i miss them everyday
sage: one day, found out they were no longer here, and was never given any details

sage sneaks off to the office - successfully
[only sage knows]
she wants two tattoos - to honour them
gets one now, in secret, on right bicep
rholl is unsurprised she wants to ask questions later about them

silk also sneaks in - fails to sneak to everyone but nikiti
wonders if the tattoo does a cover up - aka the one on his chest
nope, cause the magic may have intwined with their soul
but the mages here can maybe try to figure it out later

rudy also sneaks in - only silk doesn't realise
asks for the potential of a mentorship
though most other teams are busy
everyone is happy to chat while they're here

nikiti also sneaks in - everyone realises
nikiti: hows my son. does he have any bullies yet?
rholl: it's _creche_. no, theyre good. they're all a little weird at that age
nikiti: do you know who we are? are they coming for us??
rholl: i've seen the bulletins. but they're all more pre-occupied with the bombing in the capitol
nikiti susses that rholl _is_ a dad, but it's complicated? maybe of someone now fully an adult?
nikiti has a bounty, amongst the royal guard, for 20k gold
nikiti: any gossip? from one parent to maybe another
rholl doesn't acknowledge the parent comment
rholl: we do have a network, but we protect our own
rholl: we can't make the bulletin go away completely, but we can stop the other guilds from acting on it
nikiti: are yall a cult? asking for a friend, i wouldn't want to join another one
rholl: 120 and 55 years ago, had an issue of people pretending to be blackthorn members
r: you can get the tattoos removed if you want

all head in together
sage gives real name
silk is silk smith
rudy is quentin waterback
nikiti is nick slithers
jackie is Jackie Catz

silk gets tat on back of right shoulder
nikiti gets it on back of neck
rudy gets it on left bicep
sage gets it on back of hand
jackie gets it on the lower abdomen

trying to choose group name. its Difficult

jackie resummons the cat
silk tries to investigate - can't tell
nikiti does divine sense - doesn't get Anything from the cat, almost like a blank space

we read the quest board
protection escort would take us back to the capital
silk remembers the person's name 
> This is a higher upper society individual, friends with most of the city and is a very friendly bubbly individual. 
> You probably went to a dance with her at some point

we take the white cliff job
no extra info, just need to head over there

we head to joanne's
nice and small, hidden between other stores, red brick shop next to a giant monolith blue crystal
chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, regular witch shop with bundles of herbs and crystals everywhere, locked box by cash register
shop keeper behind a magic beaded curtain working on stuff

she comes out, has a lenticular name-plate with 'joanne' and 'jo'
has sparkling red eyes, cropped hair, short (4' 10)
sage and rudy notice a small red cross on the wrist, with two smaller red crosses to the sides

jo - they're not the kind of tattoo you want, nor the kind of tale i tell to a stranger

have a tragic reveal
saving profits from the shop to give to the kids of her fallen adventuring party members
she signs rudy's book
everyone gets a healing potion, rudy has three diamonds

we head to the dragons vault
far more low lit, but also witchy
kid on shop keeper's knee (halfling, long braided hair, dark brown skin,, who's singing to them to heal their scraped knee
sage nat 20 to join in, casting healing word

we get a wagon and cows
> blube, jetty, mood, lube, letty

---

Sage flies up to get a lay of the land with her cool emerald wings, getting us safely past Zripton City.

Nikitih helps lifts the cart over areas of difficult terrain, fully bypassing them.

Jackie gets Jasper to scout ahead

Rudy works with the cows to get them to stay strong

Silk does a performance in a nearby town with Jackie - Shakespeare in the park, feat fire breathing cat

We choose our team name - king wizard and the lizard kings

---

Whitecliff is built on a natural sea harbour, a beautiful picturesque town, though weirdly quiet right now.

We head to the Mayor's house - red carpet down marble stairs out the front entrance
Guy in a very red suit - butler - warns us to be on our 'best behaviour'
Immaculate and expensive looking building, red roses and gold accents, 

reach the office, lit with candlelight
mayor - high elf with long red hair and piercing eyes, pockmarked silver-hued skin
- Avarelle Femorah

noises - forest, butchers, bakers, herbalist, graveyard, and around town - at the top of the town
disappearances from around town
- 4 members of the church in the graveyard
-  - all around 25 years old, dragonborn, elf, dwarf, gnome
- the baker
- the butcher's daughter (was going to get married shortly)
- 3 fisherman (permeant bachelor)
- herbalist's assistant 

he doesn't believe in the church - but the town are very set on it
he also doesn't actually wanna be here / be the mayor / care about these appearances
been the mayor for 60 years - since he got here and previous mayor died and no-one else wanted to role

---

We head to the church of Umberlee
- the reason the town is quiet is cause everyone is in the sermon
- sermon is that the issues are umberlee's wish and we've just got to appease her

---

Poker game in the grass while waiting for the sermon to be over
silk and jackie w/ nat 1s (silk taught jackie the wrong rules)
nikitih pulls a win!

---

head into the church
rudy - we've been sent from blackthorn!
priest - who hired you? we're perfectly good as is, we don't need you
rudy - client privilege 

he's a very Staunch and Stubborn guy
- we shouldn't be interfering with umberlee's affairs 

noises - thumping, then something on the wind like whimpering and groaning

silk tries to get in an argument with this guy about why he's wrong
gets dragged away

---

head to the tavern, as its now filling up
grab our rooms for the night - getting 3 between us
and rudy gets us a round of drinks, and we settle in to begin our investigations and questions here
