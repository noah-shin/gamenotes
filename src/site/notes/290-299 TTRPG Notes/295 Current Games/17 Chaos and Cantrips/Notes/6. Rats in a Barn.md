Itty and bitty can feel the claw marks inside from the hands emerging
Just soil inside though

Head back to the wagon
Feel the back of it rattle a little
Unknown - not an earthquake

Head into rattle
No signs of any people, even recently
Tools left scattered around - not packed up, half finished job (not dropped, but lazy)
Each house - sloppy red X painted on the door
Windows are shattered, glass with dried blood - a few weeks old
Not a lot of animals here either

bitty sees bones near the farmhouse

head in
john cuts open the door a bit to see a pool of rats - surprisingly quite, very hungry
throws sage up to the roof
can see a Giant Rat, glazed blue eyes, in the centre

bitty hands over some of basil's rations
more rats turn up - two more swarms

combat!

kill all the rats
search inside
find some clothing - dark leather jacket with crimson mud dried on it
rat dropping and bones in the stalls
molehill-esque holes in the floor around the stalls - like at the windmill
around giant rat is a giant rat nest, half eaten bones, empty leather pouch, coin, small scrap of paper with a drawing

Basil Sage John notice a lil earthquake tremor
Rumble was directional - from feet to head

head back to cart
kid's name was Cully

rest for the night - basil lady drey and proclaimer in the wagon, itty underneath, everyone else chilling on a rooftop
