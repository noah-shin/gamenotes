basil tries to mime about the farmers
bitty scratches at the door
basil yelps
sage shoots the door next to bitty
basil readies some rope and rushes in
he attempts to tie them all up, loses the end of it

john asses the situation and gets caught up
basil hears singing in the distance - from the festival
basil and itty tie up the farmers - itty gets a nat 20
john clocks that the sound is sad and coming from underground

head towards the pantry - everything has been ransacked and the cupboard stands open
there's a trapdoor, and can smell something rotten from below

a 10ft ladder goes down into the darkness 
a storage cellar, with root veg
wall has partially collapsed, revealing a dark tunnel

rat on invisible shoulder, itty heads down
hears the festival song, but with poorly written lyrics, in a woman's voice
the voice is tired, husky, singing as lazily as possible cause she doesn't have any energy left
the melody is slightly off as well

rest of the group head down, staying behind
can tell that the rot is veg And meat

deeper we get, looks freshly dug, and poorly done - just for the purpose of fitting a person through
can tell that the song mentions a young boy named Cully
about her saving him

turn the corner, and the cause of the stench is apparent
a pile of farmers, all their limbs are cleanly removed and set in a pile in the corner

at the front, kiana sits there, singing

she words are flipping between him behind dead and her saving him
but she genuinely believes both versions, almost like someone else is singing the other part of it

john walks in
kiana - please go, you shouldn't be here. you have to leave now, i have to keep singing
kiana - oh hello everyone! you can meet cully, if you want to
kiana - if i stop singing, he'll wake up, he should sleep. you should go

her eyes keep darting to the pile of limbs
sage can tell that those limbs are alive
goes to investigate

the limbs come to life
kiana backs away, afraid, continues to try to sing

combat
sage gets grappled
bitty gets nat 20 for inflict wounds
itty gets a nat 20 to percieve a bullet for 6 damage through heat metal

john gets charmed, and starts protecting the soulshaker

bitty Jams their hand in, a lil tickle, and casts inflict wounds
it explodes and sploushes everywhere

kiana collapses into unconsciousness
we search the place
then head upstairs - farmers waking up
they remember the whole thing
hands itty a handy haversack

we pack up into the caravans, and back into Promise
