continue down the tunnel
hours later, cavern opens up into a large open cavern, well lit
faint smell of a campfire wafting through the air
mining equipment lay scattered around

large waterfall obscuring half the cavern
can smell fish cooking

stealth over
see a large otter sitting in a small rockpool with a net
trying to catch small lake fish
set up a nice camp with a photo frame - been down here at least a few weeks

itty tries to sneak forwards through the rockpool 
gets caught
pretends to be mineralogists, here to inspect the minerals in the dirt

otter is Lila
been living here for many years
sometimes theres this big owl thing that comes in and out at night

photo has a photo of a lovely otter family
doesn't seem to be lying- just curious - about the big owl

scaffolding reaches 100ft up for a 20ft hole in the ceiling
we all make it up
can see the celebrations happening
people dressed as business barons (parody of the government), la catrina, and los diablos
bitty spots some people pointing up at the sky and talking about an owl
10ft away, around a corner of the building, see feathers trailing away - same as cave, big speckled owl

we follow them through the alleys till it arrives at a house
we (itty) knocks
says she's seen an owl recently
she invites us in - a poorly furnished house, a small ofrenda (offering) to a stern looking man
the owl is her son, afflicted by a problem - the father was part of an evil cult
she's sincerly trying to give us all the information
the father was the first person to be afflicted with sereno
sereno is the son's fault - though by accident
son is employed by isthmund

head out
to ifrenda's in the street
basil offers some wax for his grandparents - gets a pendant
itty offers a drawing of a kobold and feels guilt

isthmund spots us in the crowd and starts running
start chase sequence
basil turns into a cheetah
coupla firebolts
owl turns up overhead, and basil gets too distracted, losing sight of isthmund
