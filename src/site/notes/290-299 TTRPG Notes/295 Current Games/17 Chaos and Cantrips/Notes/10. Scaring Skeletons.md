Leaving the Ettin's corpse behind, we continue on.

We spot the weathered town ahead, looking long abandoned.
There's an ornate carriage that looks incredibly out of place, infront of a building
The road to the building is littered with strange objects, that seem to be left behind from the former residents

Basil takes a look around - nat 20
the carriage looks fresh, can still see tracks on the road leading up.
Same tracks go back and forth quite a bit, so has been here regularly.

mines are blocked by 12 men in dark clothing

basil heads to the two horses, who look very perturbed and posh
very well cared for, with such a _beautiful_ mane

itty heads to the guys
itty - we are here to Shred. what are you all doing here?
itty - we heard through the grapevine that the Hollow was a pretty Radical Pad
guard - you can't get in. it's private property. owned by Isthmund (?) del prado

he's in the carriage
we knock, and a red skinned tiefling in his 40s opens the door
well dressed in a sharp suit, one horn is a prosthetic made of jade

he's a politician here - owning the mines and the town
awful reports of the disease going around
theyre going to burn the houses here, and something's happened around here
we're trying to clean up, me and my boys

basil can tell that it's weird for a man who values so much to waste so much time on these already deserted houses. he's very assured of himself, though.

itty - oh, we're also adventurers, who are here to try and clean up the area and stop the disease. it's much easier to pay the 3 of us than the 12 you have there, if you want?
isthmund - you're a very persuasive man. i can't stop you from going in, so boys! get out of the way for these clowns.
isthmund doesn't give the vibe of a man who wants to worry about litigation. he doesn't seem that worried about our safety, more that it'd be a pain in the ass with the paperwork.

enter mines

derelict wooden elevator, wind rushing from the depths of the mineshaft, in a crumbling hallway
reach elevator - rusted in places
bitty steps on, and the lift creaks, before settling

we continue down the corridor
we hear a thunderous blast behind us - head to the entrance, which has collapsed, 100% deliberately

basil's torchlight catches on a rusty nail, and can hear rattling behind that section of the wall, can see a wooden door hidden behind a pile of rocks
bitty goes to open the door, and a spell begins to appear underneath us, and a pit opens us, and we fall for 25-30ft. 
end up in a much bigger cavern, which smells unbearable. hundreds of humanoid and animal bones that fill the chamber, scattering as we land.
see two jellies that are feeding on the remains, and rise up through the bones as they sense us

![Pasted image 20230418204207.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230418204207.png)

some of the boens look clean cut, or have a metal attachment on them
no evidence of gnawing, etc, definitely dissolved
can see a well worn path that leads out of the room, with some fairly recent (and quite large) tracks

we start heading out the room, and see the same elevator shaft
head down a steep downhill path, the ceiling grows higher and higher
strange symbols scrawled across the walls, the skeletons of two huge creatures (ollosaurus) in the room - one embedded in the east wall, the other coiled around an altar covered in filthy feathers

bitty can read the symbols, theyre in abyssal, represent omens and prophecies
story - a creature is being twisted into an envoy of pazuzu? spreading corruption throughout the land
the writing feels very devout, sincere, and thankful

as they walk up to the altar, can see the two skeletons begin to animate and move towards the clowns, keen to protect the altar
they stand, shake themselves off, and prepare for battle

we kill the dinosaurs off (again)

altar - feathers look to be tarred to it, layers and layers very carefully placed
some coins left around it, look accidentally dropped
can tell the altar was using for worship and offerings

---

continue down
same symbols on the walls in worship of pazuzu
more foul looking feathers litter the floor, and claw marks gouge the walls

the feathers look unnatural - not from a normal creature
they're also huge feathers
this is from a fiendish creature - matching marks in the rest of the mines

we've been walking for a while 
the tunnel leads south towards san citilan

we stop for a short rest, before continuing down the tunnel
