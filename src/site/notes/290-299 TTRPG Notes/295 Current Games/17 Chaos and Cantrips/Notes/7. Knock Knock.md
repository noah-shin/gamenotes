people asleep are woken by a large rumble
similar to the one from underground - still directional

lady drey - well this is getting frightening, so let's get on to kiana's house

wander over
same broken houses and cracked glass
the plants all look dead and rotted away
one house in particular, the plants look blighted

sage basil clock that the blight looks circular gradient around the house
sage clocks that it doesn't necessarily look magical - the soil looks different (deader)
bitty knows that it must still be necromantic

we notice more mole hill raised areas around the house
this door is the only one in the area that doesn't have a red x
similar, only slightly larger, farming house with a wrap-around porch that is covered in dust, curtains drawn

itty picks the door
basil can't hear anything inside
sage casts light on a rock and throws it in
sees a streak of red on the floor coming out of one room

rat smells mud coming from first room on left
along with faint smell of people, wood, paper, mustyness
can see red handprints on the door (from being pushed open)
red on the floor is joining mud further into the room

door on right is shut
can only smell mud - ah it was on its whisker

dresser is a shut cabinet
faint human smell from top left room
nothing from 

slightly less dust in the corridor out to the left
trailing in to top left room

rat heads out

sage and basil stealths in from the main door
to bottom left room
haphazard furniture, red handprints (from the crimson mud outside) across the entire room

the room looks very still and untouched
chest against wall - sage finds working clothes in various sizes within
one is smaller than the rest - 13 rings of different types and sizes in there 

check bottom right
is a pretty neat bedroom, with a single bed and writing desk covered in paper (sketch versions of the hand drawings)
pretty bare of any semblance of a personality
finds

also finds a empty envelope to Kiana - 
also find overalls similar size to previous room

itty and bitty head round to back to look through the window

bitty on itty's shoulder, window is shut
itty gets on bitty's shoulder to look through
casts mage hand on the window latch, creaks it open every so slightly
then the mage hand opens the curtain for them to look through,
staring right at him are four, stock still, unblinking farmers in the kitchen

itty panic casts invisibility
the farmers slowly move to look at each other, then return to being stock still

itty silently climbs in through the window
bitty climbing up the ceiling with spider climb, out of sight
the kitchen has been upturned, sticky and stained floor, the room streaked with dirt and the smell of rot
the farmers have the same crimson swirling eyes as the festival

sage and basil enter an overturned dining room
stains across the floor, random, some with scratch marks
they scrape the bottom of chair legs, table legs, and sideboard
can't tell if it was a struggle or just a mess, due to the sheer amount of chaos
