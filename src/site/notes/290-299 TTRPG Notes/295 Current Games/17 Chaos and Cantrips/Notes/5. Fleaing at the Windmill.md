Farmers still look rabid, eyes still that swirling crimson

mysterious woman: i never thought clowns would be the one saving the day today
mw: i am aunt deli!

basil hands over the letter
itty bitty sage notice some strong magic as they search the farmers
the last one has a crumpled piece of parchment
with a charcoal drawing

aunt deli gasps, looking shocked
holding back tears

bitty knows its not the art of the area, not a replica of anything, but carefully drawn

deli: i'm not sure why this is here
deli: this was drawn by my goddaughter kiana, she draws a lot
deli: she doesn't live here, but in rattle, just outside of here
deli: i havent heard from her a little while, actually
deli: all these farmers here are rattle, they came to visit for the ceremony

deli: we've been having a lot of issues in rattle, the soil's been getting less and less fruitful
no major events before the bad stuff - been worried about predators
slow death, not a sudden thing

boy in picture was a friend of kiana's
the harvest matches up with his death - drowned in the lake - roughly 8/9 years ago

we'll be sent to rattle to check up on kiana

a broad-shouldered, dark skin and bright dress, woman approaches - lady drey
lives in promise, but would do anything for deli
offers us transportation to rattle

get in a covered wagon
follow the red land around the ribbon
basil notices a blight on the fauna, animals are very thin - something is stopping it happening
especially interested by the soil - basil grabs a pocketful
bitty notices necromancy vibes _everywhere_ - but low down, in isolated spots

drey: area used to be much more densely populated
used to grow too much and now can't grow enough
been deteriorating for years - could be around the same time, maybe not

family moved away

continue on, haven't seen anyone for a few hours
then off in the distance is a big windmill
sage hears someone calling out, in a muffled way, through the brush

stop the cart
jump out, head towards the windmill
itty walks forward, disembodied hand catches his ankle
soil begins to sink around the hand, trying to pull itty in
itty fails to jump away
sage shoots the hand, and it is destroyed

at the front of the windmill, the brush is moving
necromancy is clustered around the windmill
soil being thrown into the air, a man yelling

hands grab us, itty destroys two of them
gets closer, sees the man getting buried, one of the hands over his mouth

bitty dashes forward to the man
takes form of dread - a needle clown

basil manages to hook their walking stick into their clothes to stop them from going any deeper

sage pulls him out entirely, brings along a hand
bitty casts infestation - force x fleas
fleas get a nat 20, kill it, and _fling_ it into the sky

successfully murder all the hands

sage lowers the guy to the ground
man - Proclaimer Tungsten Ward

site of historical interest - one of the first windmills in promise
tungsten - writes the awakening song
changes the lyrics every year
tradition that one person writes it every year
done it for 12 years
not at the festival cause he's tired of hearing his own song - basil thinks he's honest
religious area, he looks like a religious man, wearing priest's vestments
seems dorky and genuine

investigating the mill
basil and sage find the mill is very old and dilapidated, outdated machinery, bunch of thin rats
itty and bitty investigate the holes, shoving their hands in, what will they find, dun dun duuun - 21 investigation

NOTE:
Basil's goodberrys are werthers
