Awakening Festival\|4. Awakening Festival]] >>

gammon still holding arty's wrist
she snarls at him (proper snarl), and tries to break his hold
he runs away lmao

smell smoke as we get closer to the seafood stall - just putting out a fire looking quite panicked
basil and bitty can't see anyone who looks suspicious - some people looking confused at the sky

almost looks like someone dropped a small bomb
no evidence of anything magical at the fire start
but some unusual magic around the edges
arty thinks they _are_ associated with the creatures from the mountains
basil has heard stories of invisible blue monkeys that steal your food and like fruit
sort of a folk story

basil approaches a fish stall stray cat
big invisible fast birds in the sky that the cat couldn't catch
_fanny mcgee on the other end of the market_

some of the hot sauces from those same remote mountainous locations

head to cassim
itty gets a taste test of different hot sauces
homegrown - family secret
stall is secretly bigger
crates on one wall, desk in the middle, two used camping beds
basil heads to the big Pepper crate - three straw lined cages w/ persimmons in them
arty - desk - business records, nothing too untoward
john - some boxes just full of persimmons, and his hand touches something invisible and fluffy
hear some chittering and tiny claws
Responsibility of collecting the shipments has moved to Cassim over the past few months

head to teymo and tell her our suspicions - that cassim brought them here and used them to disrupt the two biggest stalls - the seafood and noodles
head to cassim and annoy him into letting himself being brought in

lamia gives us 100gp to split between us (basil has it rn)
100/5=20 | 5 from itty to john, and 5 from bitty to arty

level up to lvl 3!

John is made of oil - thieves tools in his fingers - is an _experiment_
Arty is a vamp - has fangs and drinks blood

John: I was stolen from my village as a child and turn into a weapon
a warforged with silicon skin
tested on by the enemy
arty helped them escape

#### 4. Awakening Festival

Fleaing at the Windmill\|5. Fleaing at the Windmill]] >>

We all arrive at Basil's house - middle-aged bachelor pad in gorgeous forested location
stolen signage and normal signage across the walls
a big ole empty fishtank along one wall

arty pokes head in, then heads out to find a shadowy corner in the trees
bitty follows, fails to sneak
bitty: what are you up to?
arty: just looking for something to eat ...
bitty: is it weird if i ask to watch?
arty turns, eyes bright red, fangs out: not weird, but a lil uncomfortable, cause i don't want you becoming my food, so maybe get away
bitty: i have nothing to offer you so ...

there's a noise in the forest

arty: yeah, you probably wouldn't be the most nutritious meal here. are you going to scare away my prey?

both head off to hunt

****

john pins his skin back on his arm - starts tinkering with his internal mechanics
basil enters full host mode - tea and card games and stuff out

sleep - most people don't need a full 8 hours
bitty is interested in someone who might be like her?

morning, knock on the door
basil heads over, in fluffy dressing gown and pink fuzzy slippers
there's a rat man in a black suit, very dapper

"i thought you'd be travelling by now boss, have you heard of god's breath? they do great coffee, but drop this off to aunt deli's for me, tell them tommo sent you."
"in the center of the town, the awakening festival on right now"

bitty recognises the awakening festival - a song stuck in their head
bitty's been to god's breath to meet a friend there
god's breath - farming area, currently got agricultural difficulties

basil's done some support for the traders and farmers, especially during the festival
some people's only job is to organise the event
aunt deli is a pretty well known woman in the area

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/17 Chaos and Cantrips/Notes/0. CC Secrets#4. History roll\|0. CC Secrets#4. History roll]]

arty gets changed, new fit!

we all arrive at god's breath - in promise town, near the ribbon (area of land that loops around god's breath with fertile crimson red soil)
see the festival, people joining for a collective celebration, recounting the history of the town
stalls, musicious, news orleans blues
one stall : get your mini lookalike here (straw dolls, 7cp)
banner: welcome to the festival, please tip the musicians

bitty itty and arty at the doll stall
bitty: i might? be from around here?
awakening festival is roughly their harvest festival
bitty buys a doll: can you give me your most cursed materials
stall owner: most people already say they're cursed enough
stall owner: it's not cursed cursed, but it's a little cursed?

john at the buckaroo bull
woman in a cowboy hat: we're looking for our time to get beat today
john does fantasticly!

****

arty (currently sage) heads over
then there are screams and cries
some farmers head over, not singing, walking weirdly, staring blankly ahead, raising rusty farming implements
john sees their eyes are a swirling crimson
takes a weapon from one, they look Mad
bitty sees it's a powerful magical enchantment effect (havent come across before)

a woman with a shaved head, yellow dress, covered in body paint, flowers, and adornments, starts going against the crowd towards us
woman: jane, what's going on?
jane isn't giving any response back - one of the farmers

lesser restoration doesn't work
we knock them unconscious or tie them up

john heads to mystery woman and heals her

Rats in a Barn\|6. Rats in a Barn]] >>

Farmers still look rabid, eyes still that swirling crimson

mysterious woman: i never thought clowns would be the one saving the day today
mw: i am aunt deli!

basil hands over the letter
itty bitty sage notice some strong magic as they search the farmers
the last one has a crumpled piece of parchment
with a charcoal drawing

![Handout_Festival_Parchment_smol.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Handout_Festival_Parchment_smol.png)

aunt deli gasps, looking shocked
holding back tears

bitty knows its not the art of the area, not a replica of anything, but carefully drawn

deli: i'm not sure why this is here
deli: this was drawn by my goddaughter kiana, she draws a lot
deli: she doesn't live here, but in rattle, just outside of here
deli: i havent heard from her a little while, actually
deli: all these farmers here are rattle, they came to visit for the ceremony

deli: we've been having a lot of issues in rattle, the soil's been getting less and less fruitful
no major events before the bad stuff - been worried about predators
slow death, not a sudden thing

boy in picture was a friend of kiana's - cully
the harvest matches up with his death - drowned in the lake - roughly 8/9 years ago

we'll be sent to rattle to check up on kiana

a broad-shouldered, dark skin and bright dress, woman approaches - lady drey
lives in promise, but would do anything for deli
offers us transportation to rattle

get in a covered wagon
follow the red land around the ribbon
basil notices a blight on the fauna, animals are very thin - something is stopping it happening
especially interested by the soil - basil grabs a pocketful
bitty notices necromancy vibes _everywhere_ - but low down, in isolated spots

drey: area used to be much more densely populated
used to grow too much and now can't grow enough
been deteriorating for years - could be around the same time, maybe not

family moved away

continue on, haven't seen anyone for a few hours
then off in the distance is a big windmill
sage hears someone calling out, in a muffled way, through the brush

stop the cart
jump out, head towards the windmill
itty walks forward, disembodied hand catches his ankle
soil begins to sink around the hand, trying to pull itty in
itty fails to jump away
sage shoots the hand, and it is destroyed

at the front of the windmill, the brush is moving
necromancy is clustered around the windmill
soil being thrown into the air, a man yelling

hands grab us, itty destroys two of them
gets closer, sees the man getting buried, one of the hands over his mouth

bitty dashes forward to the man
takes form of dread - a needle clown

basil manages to hook their walking stick into their clothes to stop them from going any deeper

sage pulls him out entirely, brings along a hand
bitty casts infestation - force x fleas
fleas get a nat 20, kill it, and _fling_ it into the sky

successfully murder all the hands

sage lowers the guy to the ground
man - Proclaimer Tungsten Ward

site of historical interest - one of the first windmills in promise
tungsten - writes the awakening song
changes the lyrics every year
tradition that one person writes it every year
done it for 12 years
not at the festival cause he's tired of hearing his own song - basil thinks he's honest
religious area, he looks like a religious man, wearing priest's vestments
seems dorky and genuine

investigating the mill
basil and sage find the mill is very old and dilapidated, outdated machinery, bunch of thin rats
itty and bitty investigate the holes, shoving their hands in, what will they find, dun dun duuun - 21 investigation

NOTE:
Basil's goodberrys are werthers

Knock Knock\|7. Knock Knock]] >>

Itty and bitty can feel the claw marks inside from the hands emerging
Just soil inside though

Head back to the wagon
Feel the back of it rattle a little
Unknown - not an earthquake

Head into rattle
No signs of any people, even recently
Tools left scattered around - not packed up, half finished job (not dropped, but lazy)
Each house - sloppy red X painted on the door
Windows are shattered, glass with dried blood - a few weeks old
Not a lot of animals here either

bitty sees bones near the farmhouse

head in
john cuts open the door a bit to see a pool of rats - surprisingly quite, very hungry
throws sage up to the roof
can see a Giant Rat, glazed blue eyes, in the centre

bitty hands over some of basil's rations
more rats turn up - two more swarms

combat!

kill all the rats
search inside
find some clothing - dark leather jacket with crimson mud dried on it
rat droppings and bones in the stalls
molehill-esque holes in the floor around the stalls - like at the windmill
around giant rat is a giant rat nest, half eaten bones, empty leather pouch, coin, small scrap of paper with a drawing

![Handout_Ratnest.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Handout_Ratnest.png)

Basil Sage John notice a lil earthquake tremor
Rumble was directional - from feet to head

head back to cart
kid's name was Cully

rest for the night - basil lady drey and proclaimer in the wagon, itty underneath, everyone else chilling on a rooftop

</div></div>

Handsy Hole\|8. Handsy Hole]] >>

people asleep are woken by a large rumble
similar to the one from underground - still directional

lady drey - well this is getting frightening, so let's get on to kiana's house

wander over
same broken houses and cracked glass
the plants all look dead and rotted away
one house in particular, the plants look blighted

sage basil clock that the blight looks circular gradient around the house
sage clocks that it doesn't necessarily look magical - the soil looks different (deader)
bitty knows that it must still be necromantic

we notice more mole hill raised areas around the house
this door is the only one in the area that doesn't have a red x
similar, only slightly larger, farming house with a wrap-around porch that is covered in dust, curtains drawn

itty picks the door
basil can't hear anything inside
sage casts light on a rock and throws it in
sees a streak of red on the floor coming out of one room

rat smells mud coming from first room on left
along with faint smell of people, wood, paper, mustyness
can see red handprints on the door (from being pushed open)
red on the floor is joining mud further into the room

door on right is shut
can only smell mud - ah it was on its whisker

dresser is a shut cabinet
faint human smell from top left room
nothing from 

slightly less dust in the corridor out to the left
trailing in to top left room

rat heads out

sage and basil stealths in from the main door
to bottom left room
haphazard furniture, red handprints (from the crimson mud outside) across the entire room
![Handout_F4_Drawing_smol.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Handout_F4_Drawing_smol.png)
the room looks very still and untouched
chest against wall - sage finds working clothes in various sizes within
one is smaller than the rest - 13 rings of different types and sizes in there 

check bottom right
is a pretty neat bedroom, with a single bed and writing desk covered in paper (sketch versions of the hand drawings)
pretty bare of any semblance of a personality
finds 
![Handout_Culley_Drawing_smol.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Handout_Culley_Drawing_smol.png)
also finds a empty envelope to Kiana - 
also find overalls similar size to previous room

---

itty and bitty head round to back to look through the window

bitty on itty's shoulder, window is shut
itty gets on bitty's shoulder to look through
casts mage hand on the window latch, creaks it open every so slightly
then the mage hand opens the curtain for them to look through,
staring right at him are four, stock still, unblinking farmers in the kitchen

itty panic casts invisibility
the farmers slowly move to look at each other, then return to being stock still

itty silently climbs in through the window
bitty climbing up the ceiling with spider climb, out of sight
the kitchen has been upturned, sticky and stained floor, the room streaked with dirt and the smell of rot
the farmers have the same crimson swirling eyes as the festival

sage and basil enter an overturned dining room
stains across the floor, random, some with scratch marks
they scrape the bottom of chair legs, table legs, and sideboard
can't tell if it was a struggle or just a mess, due to the sheer amount of chaos

basil tries to mime about the farmers
bitty scratches at the door
basil yelps
sage shoots the door next to bitty
basil readies some rope and rushes in
he attempts to tie them all up, loses the end of it

john asses the situation and gets caught up
basil hears singing in the distance - from the festival
basil and itty tie up the farmers - itty gets a nat 20
john clocks that the sound is sad and coming from underground

head towards the pantry - everything has been ransacked and the cupboard stands open
there's a trapdoor, and can smell something rotten from below

a 10ft ladder goes down into the darkness 
a storage cellar, with root veg
wall has partially collapsed, revealing a dark tunnel

rat on invisible shoulder, itty heads down
hears the festival song, but with poorly written lyrics, in a woman's voice
the voice is tired, husky, singing as lazily as possible cause she doesn't have any energy left
the melody is slightly off as well

rest of the group head down, staying behind
can tell that the rot is veg And meat

deeper we get, looks freshly dug, and poorly done - just for the purpose of fitting a person through
can tell that the song mentions a young boy named Cully
about her saving him

turn the corner, and the cause of the stench is apparent
a pile of farmers, all their limbs are cleanly removed and set in a pile in the corner

at the front, kiana sits there, singing
![03-005.kianna.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/03-005.kianna.png)

she words are flipping between him behind dead and her saving him
but she genuinely believes both versions, almost like someone else is singing the other part of it

john walks in
kiana - please go, you shouldn't be here. you have to leave now, i have to keep singing
kiana - oh hello everyone! you can meet cully, if you want to
kiana - if i stop singing, he'll wake up, he should sleep. you should go

her eyes keep darting to the pile of limbs
sage can tell that those limbs are alive
goes to investigate

the limbs come to life
kiana backs away, afraid, continues to try to sing

combat
sage gets grappled
bitty gets nat 20 for inflict wounds
itty gets a nat 20 to percieve a bullet for 6 damage through heat metal

john gets charmed, and starts protecting the soulshaker

bitty Jams their hand in, a lil tickle, and casts inflict wounds
it explodes and sploushes everywhere

kiana collapses into unconsciousness
we search the place
then head upstairs - farmers waking up
they remember the whole thing
hands itty a handy haversack

we pack up into the caravans, and back into Promise

Back in Promise, greeted by Aunt Deli
Given 200GP between us

She hands Basil a package, with an address in Mil??, and thanks me for bringing the letter in the first place.

---

We arrive in Milpazul, a stone and iron city known for being magical, quite dry, a cosmopolitan trade hub.
It's a small village on the outskirts of San Citlan (the main city we're aiming for). A low stone wall surrounds the city, and a man on a horse pins up a poster on the archway into the city, before spurring his horse on and in.

![Pasted image 20230404193936.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230404193936.png)

Wood and clay houses surround a small well, and a blue sign that says 'Welcome'. Around the street, the cowboy is having a heated argument with a skeleton in a lovely magenta dress and necklaces against the exposed vertebra.

![Pasted image 20230404195015.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230404195015.png)

Itty and Bitty notice that people are looking out their windows at us, then closing their curtains at the sight of us. 

Skeleton 'Paloma isn't here. For the last time, you've got to stop coming around here and scaring people.''
Cowboy 'You need to bring her out, we know she's here.''

She asks us to escort cowboy out, will give us drinks for it.
He's looking for Paloma - with a group?

Skeleton - Rafina
Rafina - he's with bandits, some dangerous people. Gang out West.

Paloma is a hero around here - a Robin Hood figure. Falsely accused of a crime, and now hunted by bandits who work for one of the governors who is desperate to find her. Her group was attacked by someone and mostly killed. The bandits want her body (dead or alive).

Basil can also see many locals huddled in corners, huddled in blankets, trembling with cold despite it being a warm sunny day. 

Us - How are you a skeleton?
Rafina - I am an olivideo, a person who sticks around after the day of the remembered festival - the night we honour our dead loved ones.

Candellit portrait of old woman surrounded by marigolds behind the bar, murals of conflicts where the group are victorious surround the walls, 

Rafina brings over Paloma ![Pasted image 20230404201511.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230404201511.png)
Paloma -  I hope we can trust you. We've been looking for adventurers for a while. There is an outbreak of something called Sereno. It has killed mnay people in the village, and began a few months ago. 
Paloma - We found a strange owl creature, a terrible fiend. The two friends who were wounded died soon after by Sereno.
Paloma - People have seen something in the abandoned mining town we call Hollow.

Sereno, almost like they've been given a poison, and feel very cold all the time. The dark and night make it worse.
Can't tell the origin, and lesser restoration doesn't work.

---

Go shopping
Get tissues and string from a shop - shopekeep called Randy - guy who lives w/ his parents in his 30s
Hollow - used to have silver but got emptied out. Used to be called Pazu (?)
Some guys round there that don't want us hanging around and keep telling us off.

He brings us some homemade skateboards. We invite him along to Hollow to help 'teach us' (be bait).

---

Head back to the Cantina, Basil gives the package and a letter to Rafina.  Drink for the night, then have a long rest.

![Pasted image 20230418171445.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230418171445.png)

---

Next morning, people are setting up for the festival tonight. 
We go pick up Randy, Bitty accosting someone along to way to paint their face.

Heading to Hollow, walking through the desert. 
Come across an Ettin in the canyon infront of us. We Immediately start to Stab.
Itty kills it with a heat metal dagger in the leg!

Leaving the Ettin's corpse behind, we continue on.

We spot the weathered town ahead, looking long abandoned.
There's an ornate carriage that looks incredibly out of place, infront of a building
The road to the building is littered with strange objects, that seem to be left behind from the former residents

Basil takes a look around - nat 20
the carriage looks fresh, can still see tracks on the road leading up.
Same tracks go back and forth quite a bit, so has been here regularly.

mines are blocked by 12 men in dark clothing

basil heads to the two horses, who look very perturbed and posh
very well cared for, with such a _beautiful_ mane

itty heads to the guys
itty - we are here to Shred. what are you all doing here?
itty - we heard through the grapevine that the Hollow was a pretty Radical Pad
guard - you can't get in. it's private property. owned by Isthmund (?) del prado

he's in the carriage
we knock, and a red skinned tiefling in his 40s opens the door
well dressed in a sharp suit, one horn is a prosthetic made of jade

![Pasted image 20230418200445.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230418200445.png)

he's a politician here - owning the mines and the town
awful reports of the disease going around
theyre going to burn the houses here, and something's happened around here
we're trying to clean up, me and my boys

basil can tell that it's weird for a man who values so much to waste so much time on these already deserted houses. he's very assured of himself, though.

itty - oh, we're also adventurers, who are here to try and clean up the area and stop the disease. it's much easier to pay the 3 of us than the 12 you have there, if you want?
isthmund - you're a very persuasive man. i can't stop you from going in, so boys! get out of the way for these clowns.
isthmund doesn't give the vibe of a man who wants to worry about litigation. he doesn't seem that worried about our safety, more that it'd be a pain in the ass with the paperwork.

---

enter mines

derelict wooden elevator, wind rushing from the depths of the mineshaft, in a crumbling hallway
reach elevator - rusted in places
bitty steps on, and the lift creaks, before settling

we continue down the corridor
we hear a thunderous blast behind us - head to the entrance, which has collapsed, 100% deliberately

basil's torchlight catches on a rusty nail, and can hear rattling behind that section of the wall, can see a wooden door hidden behind a pile of rocks
bitty goes to open the door, and a spell begins to appear underneath us, and a pit opens us, and we fall for 25-30ft. 
end up in a much bigger cavern, which smells unbearable. hundreds of humanoid and animal bones that fill the chamber, scattering as we land.
see two jellies that are feeding on the remains, and rise up through the bones as they sense us

![Pasted image 20230418204207.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Pasted%20image%2020230418204207.png)

some of the boens look clean cut, or have a metal attachment on them
no evidence of gnawing, etc, definitely dissolved
can see a well worn path that leads out of the room, with some fairly recent (and quite large) tracks

we start heading out the room, and see the same elevator shaft
head down a steep downhill path, the ceiling grows higher and higher
strange symbols scrawled across the walls, the skeletons of two huge creatures (ollosaurus) in the room - one embedded in the east wall, the other coiled around an altar covered in filthy feathers

bitty can read the symbols, theyre in abyssal, represent omens and prophecies
story - a creature is being twisted into an envoy of pazuzu? spreading corruption throughout the land
the writing feels very devout, sincere, and thankful

as they walk up to the altar, can see the two skeletons begin to animate and move towards the clowns, keen to protect the altar
they stand, shake themselves off, and prepare for battle

we kill the dinosaurs off (again)

altar - feathers look to be tarred to it, layers and layers very carefully placed
some coins left around it, look accidentally dropped
can tell the altar was using for worship and offerings

---

continue down
same symbols on the walls in worship of pazuzu
more foul looking feathers litter the floor, and claw marks gouge the walls

the feathers look unnatural - not from a normal creature
they're also huge feathers
this is from a fiendish creature - matching marks in the rest of the mines

we've been walking for a while 
the tunnel leads south towards san citilan

we stop for a short rest, before continuing down the tunnel

continue down the tunnel
hours later, cavern opens up into a large open cavern, well lit
faint smell of a campfire wafting through the air
mining equipment lay scattered around

large waterfall obscuring half the cavern
can smell fish cooking

stealth over
see a large otter sitting in a small rockpool with a net
trying to catch small lake fish
set up a nice camp with a photo frame - been down here at least a few weeks

itty tries to sneak forwards through the rockpool 
gets caught
pretends to be mineralogists, here to inspect the minerals in the dirt

otter is Lila
been living here for many years
sometimes theres this big owl thing that comes in and out at night

photo has a photo of a lovely otter family
doesn't seem to be lying- just curious - about the big owl

scaffolding reaches 100ft up for a 20ft hole in the ceiling
we all make it up
can see the celebrations happening
people dressed as business barons (parody of the government), la catrina, and los diablos
bitty spots some people pointing up at the sky and talking about an owl
10ft away, around a corner of the building, see feathers trailing away - same as cave, big speckled owl

we follow them through the alleys till it arrives at a house
we (itty) knocks
says she's seen an owl recently
she invites us in - a poorly furnished house, a small ofrenda (offering) to a stern looking man
the owl is her son, afflicted by a problem - the father was part of an evil cult
she's sincerly trying to give us all the information
the father was the first person to be afflicted with sereno
sereno is the son's fault - though by accident
son is employed by isthmund

head out
to ofrenda's in the street
basil offers some wax for his grandparents - gets a pendant
itty offers a drawing of a kobold and feels guilt

isthmund spots us in the crowd and starts running
start chase sequence
basil turns into a cheetah
coupla firebolts
owl turns up overhead, and basil gets too distracted, losing sight of isthmund

On the horizon, towards the desert, we see an owl shaped creature flying away - towards a distant building.

In the direction of Hollow from San Citlan, but much closer.

We consider whether to just host our show now
Itty jumps ontop of a cart selling marigolds
Casts minor illusion
Gets a 28 performance

Gets everyone's attentions
Casts silent image - of Isthmund
Itty: 'Our first event is a scavenger hunt! If you find this man, you may get a portion of his fortune! Bring him here in the next ten minutes and you will be rewarded!'

A third of the crowd begin running around, ready for the hunt.

They grab a couple red tieflings in the area, but no Isthmund - no-one's seen him since we lost him.

We end up slipping away and into the crowd, and start following Bird Boy.

---

Come up to a large building in the middle of the desert, with huge wooden doors and iron fittings, 12ft tall, stone walls, a domed roof.

Basil whips out a book on architecture - can tell this building has to do with mining, used to do process elements once they've been mined.

Can see feathers leading up to the big doors, and footprints leading to a door just around the corner.

Basil tries the smaller door, and it isn't locked!
Leads to a large warehouse with a walkway around two sides of the wall
Can see in the corner, is a young man who looks very afraid, forming and unmorphing from himself into the owl. He hasn't noticed us.

---

We discuss what to do.

---

Itty opens the door - 'Hello? Pazoozoo? We have a bird friend too, we're friendly.'

The kid looks up, now human, resting a hand on his knee.
Kid's name is Serepo

Basil can tell he's been cursed.

He turns into an owl - stalks stalking towards us
Nothing we can do can heal or help him

Itty makes the kid's mother appear
The bird pulls back, but doesn't turn back
Bitty manages to wrangle (grapple with lasso)

Basil can tell its a curse glitching in and out - which is highly unusual for a curse
The owl is confused why it isn't always in its owl state
Maybe sunlight would do something?
