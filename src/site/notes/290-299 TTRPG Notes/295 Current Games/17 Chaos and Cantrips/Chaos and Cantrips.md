15/11

Market stall
See the trail of powered sugar - stops at the stall
Vader's otherwordly goods - sugars and buns and family bakery (pink patisserie)
Persimmon peel on the floor - no-one in the market sells it
no-one uses it in their cooking either

john looks up
can't see v much
_zero performance_ to disguise what he's looking for
Arty hides from the group (not the public lol)
Climbs up to the awning
Fails

John does a lift
Arty bonks head
John : I think you'll be fine, because of what you are 
(bitty and basil overhear)

john throws bitty up next
bitty notices powdered sugar up here
tiny scratch marks in the awning - like something perched
not bird claws - tighter grip and sharper claws

Lamai shoos us back to the market games
pepper challenge or battle prawn challenge

head to Sid Squid's Trusted Leek - **The Shrimpening**
shrimp cakes - best dish last year's festival
must make the shrimp cakes in record time

put on yellow apron
shadowy shapes in the water
beans on the sides

bitty basil john by tank
john wades into the water - its 10ft deep
finds them all
basil - speak with animals : hit the man in the tank!
arty finishes off the beans in a round!
john chucks a prawn at basil's feet
basil panic kills it

we win with record time
+1 renown
each get a gold medal in shape of a little squid (20gp)

****

as we emerge, we meet Gammon
nervous
gammon : it's getting out of hand, have you found any evidence?
head to seafood shop
points to floor, battered wok - says Teymo's Noodles

john heads off to buy a monocle
bitty notices more scratch marks around the awning
basil looks at the wok - a bit dented on the side its lying on, not great quality (but lamia take good care of their stuff?)

arty recognises the scratches - equipment going missing in mountainous regions

****

Arrive at final challenge
Run by the Spice Brothers
The brother at the stall is looking at us (cassim)
vee (other brother) welcomes us in

vee: i'm so sad to be leaving the company, but what a legacy we'll be leaving behind!
v: i announced it last week, but yes, i'm soon to be married to my lovely husband! 
v: we plan to spend a long time in retirement before opening an owl sanctuary!

john wins!
john gets some pots of various hot sauces

****

gammon meets us outside
g: you have to help, its gotten out of hand! my mother's stall has been caught on fire!

Awakening Festival\|4. Awakening Festival]] >>

gammon still holding arty's wrist
she snarls at him (proper snarl), and tries to break his hold
he runs away lmao

smell smoke as we get closer to the seafood stall - just putting out a fire looking quite panicked
basil and bitty can't see anyone who looks suspicious - some people looking confused at the sky

almost looks like someone dropped a small bomb
no evidence of anything magical at the fire start
but some unusual magic around the edges
arty thinks they _are_ associated with the creatures from the mountains
basil has heard stories of invisible blue monkeys that steal your food and like fruit
sort of a folk story

basil approaches a fish stall stray cat
big invisible fast birds in the sky that the cat couldn't catch
_fanny mcgee on the other end of the market_

some of the hot sauces from those same remote mountainous locations

head to cassim
itty gets a taste test of different hot sauces
homegrown - family secret
stall is secretly bigger
crates on one wall, desk in the middle, two used camping beds
basil heads to the big Pepper crate - three straw lined cages w/ persimmons in them
arty - desk - business records, nothing too untoward
john - some boxes just full of persimmons, and his hand touches something invisible and fluffy
hear some chittering and tiny claws
Responsibility of collecting the shipments has moved to Cassim over the past few months

head to teymo and tell her our suspicions - that cassim brought them here and used them to disrupt the two biggest stalls - the seafood and noodles
head to cassim and annoy him into letting himself being brought in

lamia gives us 100gp to split between us (basil has it rn)
100/5=20 | 5 from itty to john, and 5 from bitty to arty

level up to lvl 3!

John is made of oil - thieves tools in his fingers - is an _experiment_
Arty is a vamp - has fangs and drinks blood

John: I was stolen from my village as a child and turn into a weapon
a warforged with silicon skin
tested on by the enemy
arty helped them escape
