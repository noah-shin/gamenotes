John : I think you'll be fine, because of what you are

Awakening Festival\|4. Awakening Festival]] >>

gammon still holding arty's wrist
she snarls at him (proper snarl), and tries to break his hold
he runs away lmao

smell smoke as we get closer to the seafood stall - just putting out a fire looking quite panicked
basil and bitty can't see anyone who looks suspicious - some people looking confused at the sky

almost looks like someone dropped a small bomb
no evidence of anything magical at the fire start
but some unusual magic around the edges
arty thinks they _are_ associated with the creatures from the mountains
basil has heard stories of invisible blue monkeys that steal your food and like fruit
sort of a folk story

basil approaches a fish stall stray cat
big invisible fast birds in the sky that the cat couldn't catch
_fanny mcgee on the other end of the market_

some of the hot sauces from those same remote mountainous locations

head to cassim
itty gets a taste test of different hot sauces
homegrown - family secret
stall is secretly bigger
crates on one wall, desk in the middle, two used camping beds
basil heads to the big Pepper crate - three straw lined cages w/ persimmons in them
arty - desk - business records, nothing too untoward
john - some boxes just full of persimmons, and his hand touches something invisible and fluffy
hear some chittering and tiny claws
Responsibility of collecting the shipments has moved to Cassim over the past few months

head to teymo and tell her our suspicions - that cassim brought them here and used them to disrupt the two biggest stalls - the seafood and noodles
head to cassim and annoy him into letting himself being brought in

lamia gives us 100gp to split between us (basil has it rn)
100/5=20 | 5 from itty to john, and 5 from bitty to arty

level up to lvl 3!

John is made of oil - thieves tools in his fingers - is an _experiment_
Arty is a vamp - has fangs and drinks blood

John: I was stolen from my village as a child and turn into a weapon
a warforged with silicon skin
tested on by the enemy
arty helped them escape

#### 4. Awakening Festival

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/290-299-ttrpg-notes/295-current-games/17-chaos-and-cantrips/notes/4-awakening-festival/" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">

Fleaing at the Windmill\|5. Fleaing at the Windmill]] >>

We all arrive at Basil's house - middle-aged bachelor pad in gorgeous forested location
stolen signage and normal signage across the walls
a big ole empty fishtank along one wall

arty pokes head in, then heads out to find a shadowy corner in the trees
bitty follows, fails to sneak
bitty: what are you up to?
arty: just looking for something to eat ...
bitty: is it weird if i ask to watch?
arty turns, eyes bright red, fangs out: not weird, but a lil uncomfortable, cause i don't want you becoming my food, so maybe get away
bitty: i have nothing to offer you so ...

there's a noise in the forest

arty: yeah, you probably wouldn't be the most nutritious meal here. are you going to scare away my prey?

both head off to hunt

****

john pins his skin back on his arm - starts tinkering with his internal mechanics
basil enters full host mode - tea and card games and stuff out

sleep - most people don't need a full 8 hours
bitty is interested in someone who might be like her?

morning, knock on the door
basil heads over, in fluffy dressing gown and pink fuzzy slippers
there's a rat man in a black suit, very dapper

"i thought you'd be travelling by now boss, have you heard of god's breath? they do great coffee, but drop this off to aunt deli's for me, tell them tommo sent you."
"in the center of the town, the awakening festival on right now"

bitty recognises the awakening festival - a song stuck in their head
bitty's been to god's breath to meet a friend there
god's breath - farming area, currently got agricultural difficulties

basil's done some support for the traders and farmers, especially during the festival
some people's only job is to organise the event
aunt deli is a pretty well known woman in the area

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/17 Chaos and Cantrips/Notes/0. CC Secrets#4. History roll\|0. CC Secrets#4. History roll]]

arty gets changed, new fit!

we all arrive at god's breath - in promise town, near the ribbon (area of land that loops around god's breath with fertile crimson red soil)
see the festival, people joining for a collective celebration, recounting the history of the town
stalls, musicious, news orleans blues
one stall : get your mini lookalike here (straw dolls, 7cp)
banner: welcome to the festival, please tip the musicians

bitty itty and arty at the doll stall
bitty: i might? be from around here?
awakening festival is roughly their harvest festival
bitty buys a doll: can you give me your most cursed materials
stall owner: most people already say they're cursed enough
stall owner: it's not cursed cursed, but it's a little cursed?

john at the buckaroo bull
woman in a cowboy hat: we're looking for our time to get beat today
john does fantasticly!

****

arty (currently sage) heads over
then there are screams and cries
some farmers head over, not singing, walking weirdly, staring blankly ahead, raising rusty farming implements
john sees their eyes are a swirling crimson
takes a weapon from one, they look Mad
bitty sees it's a powerful magical enchantment effect (havent come across before)

a woman with a shaved head, yellow dress, covered in body paint, flowers, and adornments, starts going against the crowd towards us
woman: jane, what's going on?
jane isn't giving any response back - one of the farmers

lesser restoration doesn't work
we knock them unconscious or tie them up

john heads to mystery woman and heals her

#### 5. Flea-ing at the Windmill

Farmers still look rabid, eyes still that swirling crimson

mysterious woman: i never thought clowns would be the one saving the day today
mw: i am aunt deli!

basil hands over the letter
itty bitty sage notice some strong magic as they search the farmers
the last one has a crumpled piece of parchment
with a charcoal drawing

![Handout_Festival_Parchment_smol.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Handout_Festival_Parchment_smol.png)

aunt deli gasps, looking shocked
holding back tears

bitty knows its not the art of the area, not a replica of anything, but carefully drawn

deli: i'm not sure why this is here
deli: this was drawn by my goddaughter kiana, she draws a lot
deli: she doesn't live here, but in rattle, just outside of here
deli: i havent heard from her a little while, actually
deli: all these farmers here are rattle, they came to visit for the ceremony

deli: we've been having a lot of issues in rattle, the soil's been getting less and less fruitful
no major events before the bad stuff - been worried about predators
slow death, not a sudden thing

boy in picture was a friend of kiana's
the harvest matches up with his death - drowned in the lake - roughly 8/9 years ago

we'll be sent to rattle to check up on kiana

a broad-shouldered, dark skin and bright dress, woman approaches - lady drey
lives in promise, but would do anything for deli
offers us transportation to rattle

get in a covered wagon
follow the red land around the ribbon
basil notices a blight on the fauna, animals are very thin - something is stopping it happening
especially interested by the soil - basil grabs a pocketful
bitty notices necromancy vibes _everywhere_ - but low down, in isolated spots

drey: area used to be much more densely populated
used to grow too much and now can't grow enough
been deteriorating for years - could be around the same time, maybe not

family moved away

continue on, haven't seen anyone for a few hours
then off in the distance is a big windmill
sage hears someone calling out, in a muffled way, through the brush

stop the cart
jump out, head towards the windmill
itty walks forward, disembodied hand catches his ankle
soil begins to sink around the hand, trying to pull itty in
itty fails to jump away
sage shoots the hand, and it is destroyed

at the front of the windmill, the brush is moving
necromancy is clustered around the windmill
soil being thrown into the air, a man yelling

hands grab us, itty destroys two of them
gets closer, sees the man getting buried, one of the hands over his mouth

bitty dashes forward to the man
takes form of dread - a needle clown

basil manages to hook their walking stick into their clothes to stop them from going any deeper

sage pulls him out entirely, brings along a hand
bitty casts infestation - force x fleas
fleas get a nat 20, kill it, and _fling_ it into the sky

successfully murder all the hands

sage lowers the guy to the ground
man - Proclaimer Tungsten Ward

site of historical interest - one of the first windmills in promise
tungsten - writes the awakening song
changes the lyrics every year
tradition that one person writes it every year
done it for 12 years
not at the festival cause he's tired of hearing his own song - basil thinks he's honest
religious area, he looks like a religious man, wearing priest's vestments
seems dorky and genuine

investigating the mill
basil and sage find the mill is very old and dilapidated, outdated machinery, bunch of thin rats
itty and bitty investigate the holes, shoving their hands in, what will they find, dun dun duuun - 21 investigation

NOTE:
Basil's goodberrys are werthers

Rats in a Barn\|6. Rats in a Barn]] >>

Itty and bitty can feel the claw marks inside from the hands emerging
Just soil inside though

Head back to the wagon
Feel the back of it rattle a little
Unknown - not an earthquake

Head into rattle
No signs of any people, even recently
Tools left scattered around - not packed up, half finished job (not dropped, but lazy)
Each house - sloppy red X painted on the door
Windows are shattered, glass with dried blood - a few weeks old
Not a lot of animals here either

bitty sees bones near the farmhouse

head in
john cuts open the door a bit to see a pool of rats - surprisingly quite, very hungry
throws sage up to the roof
can see a Giant Rat, glazed blue eyes, in the centre

bitty hands over some of basil's rations
more rats turn up - two more swarms

combat!

kill all the rats
search inside
find some clothing - dark leather jacket with crimson mud dried on it
rat dropping and bones in the stalls
molehill-esque holes in the floor around the stalls - like at the windmill
around giant rat is a giant rat nest, half eaten bones, empty leather pouch, coin, small scrap of paper with a drawing

![Handout_Ratnest.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/295%20Current%20Games/17%20Chaos%20and%20Cantrips/Notes/Handout_Ratnest.png)

Basil Sage John notice a lil earthquake tremor
Rumble was directional - from feet to head

head back to cart
kid's name was Cully

rest for the night - basil lady drey and proclaimer in the wagon, itty underneath, everyone else chilling on a rooftop

</div></div>
