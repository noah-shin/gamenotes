We've all ended up in Neverwinter
Sat in a tavern

Gundren Rockseeker has asked for people who will bring a caravan to Phandalin.

We're in the wagon, packed with food and supplies, pulled by two oxen
Kestrel and Osmo sat at the front

Notice two horses, dead, in front of us
Satine strides forward, says a prayer over them
Felni starts crying, runs forward as well
Kestrel jumps off, heads halfway there
Osmo sticks with the cart

Kestrel slaughters one with a firebolt
Osmo panics and does the same
Satine picks Felni up by the head for a Lay On Hands
The three of them around one goblin
Osmo fighting one at range, insulting and yelling at each other
Satine crushes the goblin with a warhammer squash
Felni rushes towards the last goblin with a wild look in their eye
Kestrel subtle kills them, pretending it was Felni's kill

Osmo is like . ah shit, we just killed people
Kestrel: was that your first kill?
Osmo: Of course?
Kestrel: Look, you can take their ears, and get money for them, as proof

Satine is paladin of Sune - goddess of love and fire

Osmo starts collecting the ears and going through the bodies with a morbid curiosity and detachment
Realises that these goblins have been using this area for ambushes for a while
Probably a dozen goblins, and two humanoid bodies dragged down the trail

---

We put the ox and cart hidden in a ditch
Then start down a forest trail - Kestrel, Felni, Osmo, then Satine

Satine and Osmo have a chat about theology and beauty
Kestrel steps in a snare and is suspended upside down, 10ft in the air
Osmo fails to use mage hand to undo the knot
Kestrel cuts himself down
Felni tries to catch him, nat 1, with a minus 1
Satine catches him, and just holds him for a second

Now Felni, Osmo, Satine, then Kestrel
And we slowly start to hear more forest life - like a river bubbling nearby

Felni and Kestrel head over
Felni notices that a small area next to the stream has been flattened out to create a lookout post, with two pairs of goblin ears pointing out of it
Osmo and Satine are motioned over to them
Felni and Osmo try to stealth forwards
Osmo fails, badly, panics, and firebolts one
Kestrel skewers the other
Felni jumps out of hiding like a feral animal and grapples the first
The goblin is unphased
Osmo figures out what worked before, and shoots a firebolt, killing the goblin

Osmo picks up the rest of the ears

Can hear noises from the rest of the cave
And the trail of Gundren and Sildar leads further in

We pile up the two bodies
Light them on fire
Step away
Hear ferocious barking for two minutes
Then the breaking of chains
Three wolves emerge

Start casting spells
Felni does faerie fire, gets no-one
Combat
Satine goes down to a wolf bite
Felni kills that wolf
The other wolf goes for Osmo, and takes them down
Felni stabilises Osmo
Kestrel initially nearly takes Satine down, then gets a nat 20 medicine

We short rest
