Head inside the cave, along the narrow path next to the river as it grows louder.
Camp supplies and shit around the floor
There's a fissure in the cave wall, leading up to an opening
Can hear goblin voices through the fissure

Satine climbs up the fissure, and looks in
Sees a bugbear (King Clark), two goblins, and a wolf
Bunch of loot, and boxes marked with a blue lion

We all climb up the fissure, then start a surprise round
Felni casts Entangle on them
Everyone misses their surprise advantaged attacks

Felni hits the wolf, and King Clarg (the bugbear) yells 'No! Ripper!'
Kestrel kills the wolf
Satine hits King Clarg
Osmo kills Globby
Felni thorn whips the second goblin
King Clarg fails to hit Satine
Osmo kills the last goblin
Kestrel kills King Clarg, skewering him through the crown of his head

We loot the room, and find:
An opened treasure chest
	600Cp
	110SP
	x2 potions of healing
	Jade statue of frog with two tiny golden orbs for eyes, small enough to fit in a pocket
Sacks of potatoes in the boxes, and other things you find in a general store
	Lion symbol is 'Lion Shield Coster Ltd'

Satine uses one of the potions

Osmo heads out the north, to a large cavern, half filled with a large pool (which creates the river)
Can see three goblins next to two paths leading out

Kestrel cuts off the bugbear's head
Satine presents it, and tells them 'Your King is dead! You are free!'

One goblin runs off, the rest start chanting 'Yeemik!'
A few minutes later, a goblin arrives on a palaquin carried by six more goblins
The first goblin is dragging a gagged older human - Sildar

Satine asks for Sildar, and Yeemik offers everything in the cave
We head out, with Sildar in tow, heading back to Phandalin
