Satine gives Sildar a dress, low cut in his front

He asks us about Gundrem
	He heard about 'the Black Spider', and the dwarf was to be brought to him

Sad we didn't find the missing map
	Showing the secret location of Wave Echo Cave
	A cave that, 500 years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made Phandelvers Pact where they shared this cave and mine
	Where they built the Forge of Spells
		Where magic items could be crafted easily
	Until the orcs & evil mercenary wizards attacked
	The battle destroyed most of the cavern
	Until now, when the Rockseekers found the entrance and mapped it out

The track emerges out of the woods, onto the hillside
	Can see Phandalin below
	With a ruined manor house of the far east

We head to Lionshield Coster to return the stolen goods
	A woman opens the door, reading The Well of Ascension
	End up getting a reward of 50GP for the lot

Head to Stonehill Inn
	Everyone looks at us curiously
Young voice goes : Friends! - the bartender Tablen Stonehill
	His wife, Trianna
He points out Barthen, sat with his two mates, Ander and Thistle
Felni buys the three of them beer
	Felni : She's going to do business with you! (pointing at Satine)

Bartrand: There's a group called the Red Brands, making it hard for businesses to prosper, flaunting the townmasters authority. You would do a great service to this town if you could get rid of them. The mayor seems to be quite ... intimidated by them, and will not put any bounty on their head.
Bartrand: They frequent the Sleeping Giant taphouse.
Bartrand: They stole my prized goathide, once attached to my prize winning goat, named Goat, aka the Greatest of All Time.

We get two rooms, sleep for the night

Will get paid when delivering Gundren's stuff to Barthen
