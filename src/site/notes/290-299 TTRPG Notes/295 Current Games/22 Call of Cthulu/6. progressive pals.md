for various reasons, we have all been summoned to the dean of administrations - dean bryce fallon

lauren - doctor leanthra grey - prof of parapsychology
molly - flora - phd student in botany
jake - brandy blanc - french journalist
anna - erich white (weiss) - first year - little german boy
noah - professor adam shin - korean guy in his 50s - prof of biochemistry

women and youth and adam 

the dean's receptionist is looking more and more anxious as the time goes on
before prof shin walks in
when the receptionist (marcus) immediately goes to alert the dean

we all enter the office, with a comically large wooden desk
fallon is a charming man in his early 50s,*/*- very handsome,

dean : i'm sure you've all heard already, one of the history professors, charles leiter, was found dead in his office
dean : the body was quite . suspicious. it was ruled a heart attack. however, prof leiter was also in possession of some very important papers gifted by the hobb house estate

hobb house - one of the founding families of arkham
joshua hobb house was a recluse, bachelor, wealthy, etc, had recently died (week or so)
estate was on the outskirts of arkham

dean : they were for prof leiter to examine, perhaps archive, and have since gone missing
dean : i have heard that prof leiter was quite the gambler in his spare time, and may have been friends with less than savoury types - as the papers are quite valuable
(the arkham witch trial docs)

dean : i have called this group because i value discretion. i don't want the police involved, because of the suspicious circumstances of his death, and i want this dealt with quietly
dean : a connection may be miss amelia court - she is who found his body, and knew him more personally (was his TA)

he places a stack of papers infront of us
ontop is the autoposy

one is a letter than arrived for the dean a few days before prof leiter's death, on the assistant's desk in the morning

dean : i don't want to lay any untoward suspicion on anyone, but he's been having a hard time with another faculty member - professor harland roach - also in history
dean : whilst i don't think he has the capacity of murder, i do think harland was capable of theft

dean : i don't want to describe the body, there are some things i don't think are appropriate infront of women. i'm a progressive! but -
dean : when i saw the body, it was as though he had died screaming, his eyes swollen and clotted white, his body contorted horribly
dean : that is all i have, and i keep detailed notes
dean : the body is in cold storage in the medical suite with doctor wheatcroft
dean : the doctor demanded we cremate it immediately. in his decades of medical work, he has never seen such a horrific corpse

adam : why should i do this?
dean : you are already on thin ice. i don't want you to leave, and this will maybe help your case
adam thinks the dean genuinely wants him to stay, leanthra can tell he would really like me to leave

brandy sticks behind for a second
she asks for the keys - to leiter's office, to the ? court office ? and something unlabeled
to the dean's office

---

marcus has the radio on - but its only playing static

---

we head to doc grey's office 
she looks at the letter and recognises the handwriting - maybe someone she's worked w/ before

erich knows that prof roach is not well liked, a bit of a roach of a human being

leiter stopped by grey's office roughly 2 weeks ago
he felt like someone was after him, like there were eyes on him

---

adam opens the door to leave 
it hits someone, hear a 'fuck' and someone stumbles back
it's a student - rich frat boy first year - anthony flinders
he gives off a weird vibe - leanthra gets a lil uncomfy whenever he's around for no reason, cause he feels more himbo than threat
he's come to leanthra many times for psychological help - he's a self-proclaimed satanist with a horrible emptiness behind his himbo exterior, conspiracy theorist

anthony : i heard about the papers and think i could be a great help!
anthony : everyone on campus has heard about the papers

anthony : i have some news, and it sounds crazy. i swear that amelia is a witch, i saw her doing black magic and dancing naked on campus!

brandy gets him to watch the office for anything till we get there

---

we all head to the medical school - to get a gander at the geezer (molly's bril quote)
head to the morgue - the corridor in is so cold our breath fogs - which is actually quite unusual

entering the room, there's filing cabinets, six beds (with six bodies), and a sleeping medical student at a desk

brandy heads to the back to the filing cabinets - they're locked
she goes to pickpocket the medical student - hand comes out covered in this stringy white stuff after pricking it on something in the pocket

adam pulls back the sheet
barely recognises leiter, his face frozen in the moment of death and in an expression of terror

we re-examine the autopsy report
hear a cleared throat - prof wheatcroft
the med student wakes up to the sound
