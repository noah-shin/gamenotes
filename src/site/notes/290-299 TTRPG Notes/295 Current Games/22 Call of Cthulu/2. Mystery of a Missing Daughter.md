Our journey starts, saturday morning, june 20th 1925, at 10am

bennington, vermont - gunfight last night on the edge of the forest
talks of escaped kidnappers
three gangsters, some people shot, some dea

lucas strong's missing daughter
everyone in town has been invited to a meeting in the town hall
5k reward for anyone who can do the rescue

---

we were once in maine, maine, investigating the local occult activity

the cult leader (anna's chara) knows they're called the 'cult of gla'aki', 

and were searching for a large crystal shard buried deep in the ground
by the time it was found, it was surrounded by cultists who have been dead longer than we first knew them

---

jake - ross dwyer - nurse
just wants everyone to be safe, a lil stressed out, trying to paying off student loans

noah - una kim - chauffer
ross' driver, escape korea (japanese colonisation), became a driver in the us, before bagging this job

molly - jeremy - antiques dealer
inherited an estate and just sold it with no understanding of how much it should cost

lauren - theo - federal agent
here chasing down a lead for a job, hanging out with us to make sure nothing terrible happens

molly - betty green - cult leader
born christian fundamentalist, became 'the eternal soulmate', using her charisma to uhhh gain their money

---

theo can spot a richly dressed man addressing a small group in the center

jeremy and una approach, can catch him saying 'there's an extra 25 dollars in it for you, if you can get that done'

jeremy breaks the ice with convo of his pocketwatch
this is mr strong
if we wanna make 25 dollars, we need to -

---

the doors to the police station open up
a slim man in late 50s, smartly dressed in police uniform, thick grey moustache, horn rimmed glasses, sherrif badge, walks through
sherrif jenkins

he starts explaining the situation & need for a search party
sherrif: 'sydney harris and his gang have kidnapped Jane Strong'
a police woman starts distributing wanted posters
' the gang wanted a ransom for 10k. the handover was last night, and was going smoothly, until the gang got twitchy and started shooting. they fled into the forest with the money and jane, after killing two officers'

theo and mate walk up
theo asks for a case file and offers to help
kidnapping seems out of their normal purview
there are rumours that she is a little bit of a floozy, and kept locked up by mr strong
is a one-off unusual case of violence, but there are been reports of strange happenings recently, and some folks have been getting ansty (hunters from the forest)
- reporting bad dreams
- can be found in local hardware and gun store

---

it would be a real kindness to strong if harris' body were to be 'found'

the forest used to be used in the civil war by deserters to get the canadian border, goes through the forest and curves around a lake
he marks it on una's road atlas

---

we reconvene, discuss
car is called betsy
drive to the hardware store - arthur j spencer's hardware and gun store

mate ross and jeremy head in

big hunter guy comes out
he spits on the ground infront of theo
theo grabs his arm, and whispers 'you do realise you've now drawn my attention to the mighty fine gun on your back, and a worse person could probably fine or arrest you'
guy: ' i don't care about no pig', and he wanders off

---

inside the flashlights are *expensive*
ross accuses mate of being part of a cult
mate gets asked to leave - the word brings out a sudden tension in the room

jeremy gets camping equipment for five (for 70 dollars)
una gets the crate, then waits for jeremy to head out, before asking about stories of the forest
the hunter in the queue pipes up and mumbles 'no point in going into those woods, you're not going to come back out'
Jayne says that there's something evil in them there woods
she looks reluctant to say anything that might associate her with ... not being mentally sound
she's 'heard rumours' that there's something buried out there
she remembers that Mr Strong was mining for something a while back
he mines often, and sometimes 'loses his daughter'

---

una catches the librarian after he pays
stories about the ghosts - union army getup (deserters)
no record of anyone coming through here, but the records aren't the most well kept

---

its now noon
- head back to the town hall

theo gets the file from the sherrif
we all head into the forest
we go for a north easterly direction - close to how mr strong directed us (we should go slightly more east)

file is of the three gang members and their crimes
Eugene clayton and christopher dobbs
does not seem like organised crime between them

there's a big gold mine in the forest - owned by strong
there have been people going missing over the past two/three weeks
latest was a group of artist who went into the woods and haven't been seen in a week
mostly hunters

we cannot see a decent place to mine on the map - and it isn't labeled
mr strong petitioned for the permits to mine about a month ago
permit covers edge of forest to the lake

---

we start down the trail
una navigating it
theo can see the occasional drag mark and footfall
finds something he's never seen before - three ft long fleshy spine
	sharp on either end, which is glistening with a clear liquid
	lodged into a drag mark

the glint blinds ross for a moment, then fades, but he can't move, can't speak
he can see the shore of a stagnant lake, with black stinking water, a pale moon reflecting off the surface
he feels like there's a presence behind him
a strange light pulses beneath the water, which begins to ripple
long black tentacles begin to approach him from across the surface
as they rear up, the strange spines emerge and strike out at him

ross rears back and just walks away

theo picks it up. doesn't experience anything
	realises that someone stepped on it 

ross is walking
lost in his head
ross hears a gunshot, and is forced backwards - shot in the shoulder

we get there
una can pinpoint the person running towards us, crazed looking
he emerges from the bushes - it's euguene
looking far worse than his mug shot, clothes ripped, pupils are pinpricks

and he shoots again
