jeremy and una navigate the group - following the footprints

nothing is going on in the forest - no life whatsoever, or any of the search parties
after a couple of hours, come across a trail of tyre tracks that have cut through the forest and are heading north - similar to the footprints

keep following along the footprints
then can hear the distant sound of an engine stopping
can see a dirty truck
one of the backj wheels is trapped in mud
guy gets out to take a look
	glasses, young-ish, very very tall, oversized coat pulled tight, widows peak
	he looks disconcertingly pale
	and smells ... tangy? sharp tang

three of us stealthed, the eternal soulmate rushes over to him
	acting scared and defensless

guy: 'you lost?'
mate starts crying: 'i came hear the visit jane, but she was kidnapped, so im here to help find her, but i got lost!'
he doesn't react, deadpan face
guy: 'i'm heading to the dig site, i could take you there?'

we approach, acting as though we found her
the guy just had a vacant long stare at mate, then had to rip his eyes away
ross can see he Is breathing, though stiff, and the palm of his hand is red

the gang can notice that he's looking at all our chests - a quick glance as though looking for something?
he's slowly working his jaw - like he's pained to be talking
every time, before he speaks, he tics his head to the side, as though listening, before responding

his name is james stanton

james: if you work for mr strong, i'm sure my supervisor would love to talk with you

una gets the car out the mud
james pushes away the tarp on the back, shoves them further back to clear a lil bit of space, then covers the boxes again
una, mate, and jeremy climb onto the back of the pickup truck
jeremy sprawls
james speaks, slightly louder : 'be careful, there's a bunch of dynamite back there'

ross is next to james, can see the palm - cleanly covered in red across the palms and fingers
james cracks open the window, very mechanically, as the tangy mouldy smell gets stronger
ross can id the smell and red as blood & rotting meat

ross: 'sorry, james, do you know that you have blood on your hands?'
james doesn't look over: 'what are you talking about?'
ross: 'are you okay?'
james wipes his hand on the coat: 'i'm okay'
pushing hard enough it should be hurting him - but seems fine?
coat opens enough to see white tank and jeans
	with a big sucking wound - a hole punched right through him, the margins ripped open, with a green tinge (powdery green, not part of the wound itself)

ross can see it, and feels sick
	feels the same wave of nausea as the dream sequence
	develops hemophobia

---

the path splits

the three in the back can all hear the sound of screaming in the distance, down a different fork
	multiple voices overlapping and screaming
	from deeper in the forest

one fork looks exactly like the path from jeremy's dream

---

arrive at the dig site
one of the boxes opens - has paint brushes and some paint

we can see the couple of cabins
and a giant hole going straight down in centre of the clearing
figures pulling something in/out of the hole
by the fence are two tall, professionally dressed guards
	one in clean overalls, with spiky blonde hair and a clipboard
	and another one

james winds down the window
guard looks at us, confused, before smiling

brief convo - he doesn't believe us
james nods, not looking over
guard lets us in

he gestures at a shack - his office, and we can ask for a tour after ? 
james tells us the manager's (guard) name is Mr White.

we head to the hole
	it looks like a dig and more like a crater - something dropped to form it
	the people are hauling dirt up and out
	at the base, very deep, faintly glowing, huge, and crackled with gold, glinting all sorts of colours, eerie and unsettling, is a crystal
	this is only the tip of the crystal poking out
	can hear an ominous humming

ross notices that all the workers are visibly injured in similar ways
	their clothes are intact, but there is some blood through their shirts

mate: 'i thought you were digging for gold?'
james: 'who told you that? what we are digging for is far more important'

we can also hear something that isn't, but could be screaming, coming from the lake
the lake looks like oil

we head over there
	everyone pushes and fails a psychology check
	become aware that everyone has stopped using the pulley, and have started following us to the lake
	but we don't care, and its oppressive, until it isn't - and we begin to like the feeling

una and mate realise that something is wrong here
jeremy and ross just want to get right into the lake - they want to become With the lake

ross develops a phobia of una and mate
	and the lake is offering safety
jeremy looks at the dirt we're walking on, and his mouth starts watering
	and also wants to be in the lake

as soon as they both hit the water, they want to leave, they want to get deeper
and they feel a skinny lil tentacle
	ross can feel it snake around their neck and rest on his face
	jeremy feels it curl around their arm, aiming towards his neck

una and mate are shocked back into sanity as they watch this pair run into the lake
	can see at the far end of the lake, can see three yellowy stalks pop out and are lazily blinking at us
