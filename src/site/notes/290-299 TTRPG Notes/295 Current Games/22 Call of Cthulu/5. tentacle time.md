una goes to make a lasso to grab jeremy
but there's not enough rope

una ties the rope around theo, who starts wading in to grab ross
as soon as they step in, its like pushing through jello

---

ross wants to be with the lake, and is deliberately breathing in the water
the tentacle on his face slips into his mouth
and has wrapped several times around his neck

theo shoots the tentacle off
though it continues to slide down his throat
theo grabs jeremy
then hauls them both to the shore

una chops the tentacle on jeremy off
the thing in ross' chest explodes into a spike

we try some more combat
the creature begins to emerge out of the lake
the slashes out 
cuts una, mate, and jeremy in half, immediately killing them

the members of the dig site begin walking into the water

the spike is slowly emerging from ross' chest

theo attempts to car bomb the crystal
as they are running to the tank, they pass the cabins
before hearing a quiet, young sounding voice : 'help me, please!'
theo can see a young girl banging her fists on the window of the cabin

ross gets into a car and just drives off lmao
theo grabs the dynamite, lights it, and drops it into the hole w/ the crystal, then starts running

there's a vision
mark - as he was when he was possessed, but possessed by something else
mark : 'thank you theodore, for freeing me. i will consume this world, like i have hundreds before you'
theo shoots him in the head
his vision goes black
