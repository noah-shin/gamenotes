Whats underneath]]

combat starts! 

theo shoots
guy's gun jams
jeremy _shoots him through the head_

he's got a gunshot wound in his arm (like he's recently been in a fight)
knuckles also bruised
	in the wounds there's a green powder
specks of paint (white, red, blue) on his clothes
long blue hair ribbon jammed in a pocket (some brown hairs still attached like it was ripped off)

we argue about what to do with the body
theo helps una tie it up 

it's going to be very dark very soon
head 20 min down the road before camping for the night
set up watches

---

realise the forest has been super empty so far
not even any animals! so its probably good lmao

two people failed a power roll :eyes: jeremy and mate

the eternal soulmate has first watch
	swear they can hear the faint sound of panting/heavy breathing
	with some occasional drag thump

mate tries to wake theo up
but he doesn't move / wake up
mate can't wake anyone up

mate goes back to listen
then hears a gasping breath, then nothing

theo can be woken up at the end of mate's watch
they have a convo about the sound (and that mate calls people minions)

mate: 'humans have rights?'
mate: 'i don't sleep, i dream'

the rest of the watches go smoothly

jeremy doesn't normally dream
	path through a forest
	covered in sickly yellow leaves, like the trees have been infected
	there is a heavy silence, like everything is dead
	something calling him down the path
	a clearing
	yellow light reflects off water
	a twig snaps behind him
	as he turns to look, a sharp pain piercing through his chest, waking him up

mate dreams
	yellow leaves falling slowly falling from the branches above
	blades of light stab through the darkness
	a dilapidated wood cabin ahead
	shadowy figures emerge, advancing slowly, with purpose
	mate cannot run, screaming at her limbs to move
	the figures shift into focus, wearing strange old clothes
	one, a man, in the middle, says 'come with us. join us in his service, embrace your new destiny, and bask in his glory'
	his face is lifeless, pale, unblinking
	pale powdery green smear down from from his eyes
	he smiles, and his skin cracks and starts to peel away

everyone wakes up feeling still tired

---

morning
chat a lil
	divert on human rights, and minions

head to the body
	hasn't moved
the general area has some pretty deep and fresh boot-prints
	basically from direction of camp, to body, then into the forest
	as we get back to camp, they come from the forest, then pass along the camp, then move out into the wood

we start following footprints into the wood
