23/01/23

Morning routine before heading out to meet Captn Torn at the mines
twins aren't talking to each other after the korith conversation last night

torn along w/ five people - mismatched looks, worn equipment, crudely drawn logos of multiple crime organisations, either noobs or locals
pesk - trandosian big guy 
tikka - twilek small sassy woman
yeller - mon calamari fish guy w/ bulbous eyes, sniper rifle
will - quarren fish guy with tendrils, rotary gun
chuck - guy in shitty poor faceless armour w/ signs of _so_ many gangs, poorly held rifle

we are going by lorelai (ey), franky the mad man (el), kion

sent some guards ahead, not reported back
10k credits split between 8

head to elevator
chuck drew the symbols on himself, to be approachable to these guys so they'd hire him
- fanboy in the way that he saw his older brother play a game and now its his favourite video game ever

arrive at bottom of tunnel
they dont want us here - think they could do it themselves

ey w/ chuck, el w/ will, k w/ pesk

twins hear shuffling super far down, occasional cracking and crunching sound
k feels like someone is straining nearby in the force - light use

tikka sees a large crack running the length of the cave towards the elevator
ey knows this is not a natural cave in - its the force, manipulated around the group as a whole

we start running
walls are cracking, cracks start splitting, intensifying between the two groups
cracks are fine further back, its worst right beneath and behind us
floor gives way - slide down into a warm liquid that cushions the floor

now in a dark cave system
ey hears shuffling, like feet being dragged
two groups separate
k feels that lingering force presence from the centre of the cave
dead bodies lingering in the corridors and half-submerged
from uniform and fresh blood - these are the miners who have gone missing

all step into the water
k feels the pressure return - not on the environment but on _us_ - now dark?
grabbing onto you, squeezing, pulling the life away
the sensation washes away, into the water
the bodies begin to twitch
zombies rise

roll initiative
el uses lightning

make it out and through
follow the force presence
creature on a elevated part of the floor - large damaged hooded brown robe, face obscured, dripping, staring at us three

k: who are you?
figure reaches into its chest, revealing an orange, slightly blackened hand, nails grown and dirty
pulls out a lightsaber - one half damaged, scarred, sparking - other side erupts an orange blade
illuminates his face - two horns but one is gone, large scar down his face, missing an eye
