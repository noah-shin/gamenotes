#### 1. Everything is Fine

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





29.03.22

Simultaneously a lawless world and a place of mourning, the galaxy is made of warring families and struggling people.

We zoom into Tattoine, Jabba isn't home. Teemo's shit the bed, so he calls some bounty hunters in to Mos Latina, Jabba's Summer Palace.
We are with a few Gamorrian guys and a protocol droid (older, with a banged up chestplace).

KiOn's been 'asleep' for the journey (few hours). 
El's been staring at them, can tell they're not asleep.
Guard's cleaning their weapons.
Ellya tosses a card to see if KiOn's awake. KiOn catches it, gently throws it back.

We arrive, most people here work for Jabba.
Teemo is busy, so we head to 'Jabba's Hutt', ran by a family (MacKal ?), decent place.

KiOn buys a Jawa Juice
McKal - 'everything's fine'
KiOn dirty 20 insight. He's bullshitting, nervous sweat, doesn't know where his kids are, keeps looking at the time.

Ellya to KiOn - ' You made Ozzy seem like he had charisma'

Bell over door rings, gonk droid comes and replaces the water cooler.
Gonk droid walking kind of heavy, El figures there's something inside it.
Both Belfrond twins inside have fallen asleep (just gotten drinks from McKal)

El gets a caff. Protocol droid summons us, we head out.

El - ' I'll grapple that gonk '
El gets 21 to move gonk into the alley
- 'I need to get inside you'
- 'You seem a bit thicc'
Gonk tips over.

Ellya chats to the protocol droid.
Ey - 'Orange bikini's, can you believe it?!'

Blue guy to KiOn - ' Move, my droid needs help'
El just finds water and a gun in the gonk's trunk.

Closer we get to the Palace, it's _quiet_, all the market shops are closed.

Teemo ' How are you all feeling?'
Everyone 'Ok?'
T 'Wtf? Open the veil'
Veil opens to show a holograph of Teemo. He's wearing a wompa coat (somewhere cold?)
T 'You're not sleepy?'
All 'No? We drank but not sleepy lmao'
T 'Ah well. Someone's been stealing from Jabba. _You've_ been stealing from Jabba. You're bad enough and not loyal enough that lmao everyone will believe me.'

Roll ini
- Protocol droid slaps Ey.
- Ey shoots it in the head.
- Ey kills the other two guys in the room.
- KO kills 2nd guy
We head out the front door. 3 guys with blasters at the ready.
- Central guy has bastardised Phase I clone armour.
- Ey explodes the gonk droid, kills all three (and nearly KiOn).

We run to the barge.
Belfrond twins try to shoot us, but too 'drunk'.
Barge is being repaired, so we grab a landspeeder.

</div></div>
 


#### 2. What the Star Destroyer

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





31.03.22

There's a bag of thermal detonators (x5) in the back of the landspeeder.

We're getting chased.
- Ey shoots on, KO gets the next.
- Ey force disarm's the third guy's holocomm to Gemar, who grabs it and loses control of his speeder. Unknown if killed.

Head into a canyon, detonates canyon behind us (with x4 detonators).

(( Ozzy on holo with Teemo. 'I can deal with the three' ))

Ey phones George (himbo bounty)
G - 'this looks bad.'
G - individually, 30k. Trio, 150k.
G - I'm already strapping on my boots. You're the hottest piece of news on this dustball in a _long_ time.
G - I want my landspeeder back.

North - Tusken Raider territory & Jawa Scavenger teams (we know something's been found)
West - Dune Sea. Couple of days to civilisation.
East - Worse.
South - Teemo.

El switches driver to KO and reads the transaction details of Jabba.
- Bribes, being bribed, games, normal stuff, legal.
- Investment in armour, weapons, decommissioned ships, relics from the clone wars and old republic. 
- Unusually large investments, could be someone stealing his money.
- Twi'lek Biba Fortuna might want it? Also Temmo?
- Only morons and other Hutts go after Hutts. 

It's getting late, speeder is getting slower.
We head north, reach base of the cliffs and beginning of Tusken Territory.
Leave the speeder.
We head down and through, rather than over the mountains.

We hit a cave in the canyons, a Jawa comes screaming past.
Hear shuffling in the canyon behind us. Crew of Tusken's approaching.

Enter the cave (to avoid the Tusken's)
- 3 Jawa bodies, dead, shot by blasters in the entrance of the cave entrance. They were fleeing.
- One clutching scrap metal. Something that's been buried a _while_.
- A piece of a starship hull.
The cave is COLD with KO's danger sense.

We stealth further down
- Cave starts opening up, almost like a crater.
- We hear a chitter, a scamper, a flutter.
- Dim circle light from the back of a dark structure.
-- Logo of a seperatist ship
- A sheer drop down infront of the bridge of the ship
-- One of the main productions of the Seppies were the Genosians

We leave. Camp halfway back up the tunnel.
Ey first watch. 

El dreaming.
- Childhood home, parent's faces slightly obscured. Parents shouting at Ellya - ' We know its your fault! '
- Ellya is taking it. The shouting gets louder, parent's forms turn and vanish, room getting colder.
- Ellya walks out. Man in trenchcoat and cowboy hat follows.

KO dreaming.
- Broken up by clone's voices and screaming, shouting for their General.
- Battlefield is covered in bodies, series of explosions as (young) Korith runs into a line of battle droids.
- A line splits in the ground, swallows Korith, droids, KiOn.
- KO starts to fall, grabbing onto anything.
- An armoured hand grabs mine, then Scale brings me up, exhausted.
- Scale - 'I've still got your back'
- He turns to show the blaster mark in his back as he walks away.

Ey sleeping.
- A twisted pile of bodies, bounty hunters, friends, enemies, people long dead or still alive.
- Ozzy is at the top, holding onto El by the neck, their legs kicking.
- Ozzy - 'Humourous remark. Easy kill.'
- Ellya raises her rifle, when there's a second blaster at her side, pointing at (?)
- It's cowboy man. - 'Now now little gunslinger, don't be hasty'
- Ey knows better than to banter. Dual wield, shoots both.
- Return fire, Ey blinded.

KO woke, now meditating. 
- Sees self sat in an office. Scale opposite, drinks between them.
- Scale reciting names and numbers, crying slightly.
- Scale - You've got to go back there. End this warm for me.
-- Words come from a true light place.

</div></div>



#### 3. What do you see

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





5.4.22

KiOn reveals that they were once Jedi, and that the trio have to return to the ship.
Twins - wtf.
KO - There are those who would label you two as Force Sensitive, and hunt you down to kill or destroy you. There is being hunter for a bounty and there is being hunted by the Empire.
Twins - wtf. Why do you trust them.

KO force sense, nothing up the tunnel. Down, hears a cold whispering, slow drawn out growls. 
- Heard something similar before - O66

We head back down to the starship.
At base of tunnel, Genosian child with cybernetic limbs.
- Accidentally meets eyes with El. Child is Afraid, flees.
El heads down.
KO starts assembling two things from their belt.

Ey finds a sealed maintenance shaft.
Lmao none of us can open it.
KiOn draws their two sabers, cuts a hole in the hull. 

We hear clanging from 3 directions.
- KiOn takes a step in
- A single B1 battle droid.
- We kill 10 droids (Ey got 5, KO got 4?, El got 1?)

Short rest on the ship in awkward silence
- Twins are tense
- Ey thinking she doesn't deserve hope (and the Jedi) because she's a monster

We head further in, following the cold.
- Down corridor, then ladder into the hander bay
- Head over the door into a vent
- As we continue, metal gets newer and cleaner, lights and oxygen coming on

Same illusion for all three of us
- A trick used by Jedi & Sith

Head down corridor
- KO sees Korith for a second

Into an end room, 50x50ft
- Circular seat in center, point of meditation
- Hear marching, many more than 12 droids coming
- KiOn's commlink sparks, hears Korith - 'Watch out below'
-- Green lightsaber through the ceiling

Twins head to doors, ready to shoot
 - B1 droids coming down corridor
KO sits on the meditation circle
Ceiling falls in, three ropes.
- A few members of a clone legion. Turn to face droids, raising guns.
- One joins KO, whose armour goes back, KO looking younger.
- Young Korith drops down.

El looks around 11.
Ey sees the clone troopers, but Korith as older and in full blank. Feels the cold pulling very strong.
- Tries to disarm him of his unignited saber
- Internally 'this is not a young boy, this is a monster'

El not even in the room anymore, but alone in a meeting room.
- Figure can't quite make out yelling in a language they don't know

Ey sees cowboy in the ceiling hole.

KO stabs the ground w/ saber. Underneath is a red crystal at the base, reflecting the saber.
- KO grabs it, entire arm goes numb
- Numbness spreads, but takes it. All visions and people dissapear. Hole in the ceiling still there.
- KO is catatonic.

Ey rips the sith holocron from KO's hand
El sees it contains 'sustained lightning' and 'probe mind'

Ey slaps KO to wake up.
- KO currently in the Jedi temple. A large charming blue and bearded man reaches out and slaps KO in the back of the head.
- KO back in the room and no longer compelled by the holocron.

Game of hot potato with the holocron, ppl force disarming it. El and KO _want_ it.
- KO hits it out the air.
- Ey 'I'm the monster here, not you. Snap out of it!'
- Battle of wills
- Ey gets two nat 1s
- El w/ two 6s
- KO tries Battle Meditation and Guidance. Gets it, tucks it away.

Something else still down in the hole.

(( Nern (planet) with black fortress and that same bitter cold. 
- Young man, same age as the twins, black clothes with the imperial logo.
- Next to him is Scale.
- Korith smiles, he's excited. 'What was once lost is now found'
- Something cold was surrounded by a warm familiar light. Now he has a vague direction. 

</div></div>
 


#### 4. Escape the ship

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





More time has passed than expected
- seconds to hours, maybe days

KO reaches back into hole, finds metal components - the curved lightsaber hilts of dooku (no crystals)
ellya hears a faint tapping and chittering, against a computer
- genosian hitting a screen a good deal away
el hears a secondary metallic footstep

we start heading west - heading up and into the wind, emergency lights are on
- arrive on the bridge, most windows broken, consoles damaged, captains chair has a pillow

One working computer, has a series of dates
- 12 years ago. first entry - B1 droid with datapad
-- 'Just got news our group has been selected to retrieve some relics by Dooku. I can't wait!'
- 2nd entry - missing his forearm
-- 'We made it off Genosis! Picked up a wierd ball!
- 3rd - slouched, missing both legs
-- 'Minor issue. We crashed. I'll find a way out of this. The ball opened, a droid came out. 10% charge left.'
KO knows Genosians come from eggs

locked box - x2 light shield generators and sniper rifle
under pillow is head of commander droid 0020 (the b1 droid from the vids)
newer scorch marks on the bed - someone was welding things

x2 B2 droids approaching
- tie off rope
- el heads out
- ey freezes on way out, el catches them
- ko unties  and grabs rope, walks down side of ship
- behind the two droids is the genosian (now mismatch of chitin and the droid)

el holds ey's shoulder
ey draws on el's head
ko casts sanctuary on el
ey turns gun to self
ko force disarm takes gun
ey falls to floor, unconscious

el takes watch
ko meditates
- sees black rocky mountains and bright blue sky. small hut and outdoor firepit
el notices red under blaster mark on ko's armour, and white tattoo on back of her neck
el and ko chat. el v hesitant, refuses when ko offers the saber hilt

ey wakes, robotically sits up
ko has removed their weapons and lined them up on the side
ey straps their weapons on, while ko disassmbles the sabers
ey mutters an apology, full of embarrasment and frustration

el's commlink lights up
george 'found what you did to my speeder. it was stripped for parts!'
gemar 'that was real funny'
ey 'yeah ur gonna need george's help'
gm 'you watch ur mouth'
etc
gm 'the one time i don't want to get the bounty. i can't wait till ozzy gets to you'
el hangs up

we continue down the gorge, keep going for hours
tusken raiser (alone) at the end
- he drops 
ko runs up the wall - no tuskens around
tusken barely breathing
el uses translator 'who did this?'
tusken 'death machine'
el 'if we heal you, will you hurt us?'
tusk 'leave me. i will owe no deby to you.'
ey reaches out, casts 'give life'
tusk 'thank you. i was a bit delirious, refusing your help'
ey 'no problem. where's the rest of your group?'
tusk 'dead. only safety is with rest of my people, i just have to find them. i will not forget this, what are your names?'
ey 'ellya grimmgullo'
el '... el'
tusk 'roxxis. i'm happy to accompany you to mos eisley'

(( days ago, a pile of tusken bodies in a mound and burning. chieftan falling on their knees, ozzy stood before him. 'humourous statement. easy prey.' ))

</div></div>
 


#### 5. Breaking Connections

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





21.04.22

KO jumps down back into the canyon. Chats with Roxxis
- He's the only one left.
- It was a droid.

Ellya starts rummaging through El's shit.
Gets caught.
Ey 'I got a vibe you have something you shouldn't have.'
We keep walking for the rest of the day, find a small place to camp.

El's been recording KiOn.
Ey searched their stuff and deleted the files from the holo recorder.

KO's meditation - memory
- jumps to grab a library book
- Vesper 'Just remember to ask for help.'

KO's watch - sees a probe droid fly overhead. 
- may not have seen us

Everyone wakes. Roxxis carves a sign into the sand - Safe Space

In Balazar :
Ey 'How could you? What good did you think the recording would do?'
El 'I'm just doing what is best for us. For you!'
Ey 'It's always been whats best for you. Lets keep me protecting you because when its _you_ it doesn't go too well, does it?'
El shoves past, mad.
In Basic :
Ey 'Are you going to keep doing that?'
El 'Fuck you Ellya. I'm protecting you. You don't know the lengths I've gone to!'
Ey 'You don't know the lengths I went for _you_.'
El 'It's above your paygrade.'
Ey 'So I'm just your shadow. Your bodygaurd, your weapon?'
El 'Yes. A deficient one.'

KO gets between them.
Ey tells her about the recordings.
Sniper shot between Ey's feet.
Ey kills it.

We run. El surprisingly not super tired.
Reach end of gorge, slow down
Sand hasn't been disturbed in a while
There are spaceships, civilisation ahead.

Roxxis gives a black melon to El. (1hp to anyone who drinks it)
He heads off into the mountains.

We chat. Promise to talk it out when we leave.
KO curious as to why El hates her

Head into town. Outer docks, board a shit ship.
Approach a droid - 3ZQ2 (Threezy)
Ship - Jackpot
Captain - Savi Tantra - younger woman, wearing a flight suit, short teal hair
We are Leah, Jonathan and Scale Vesper.
Offer to work for passage.
Captain's quarters offlimits. Cockpit only w/ Savi. Don't go into storage room at back of ship.

Ey insight. She's seen some action, recently?
KO can tell new hyperdrive fitted - designed to be _fast_. Engine of a smuggler.
Trust will come after discretion.
KO fixes the hyperdrive. El fixes the landing gear. Ey fixes the ventral guns.

(( Roxxis has been walking along, alone. He gave away his last ration. He falls to his knees, turns and sees a whole tribe to take him in. ))

</div></div>
 


#### 6. To Talk About

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





12.5.22

(( Star Destroyer orbiting a planet on fire, and in the near distance, a planet of water. An officer anxiously waits for an incoming guest. With short black hair, Korith walks straight to the Captain, who is nervous, reluctant. 
Captain 'Our vessel is completely at your disposal.' ))

Ey heads to workshop to clean guns.
El and Ey walk past each other.

KO chats with Ey in the bunks.
Ey 'Freedo was as much my saviour as my jailer'
- part of a crime syndicate, were going to run it as equals
- now on run from a large syndicate, exiled from their planet
- freedo is hunting them

El decrypted more of Jabba's data
- list of possible people who couldn't done the embezzling
- amounts grew to a reckless amount later

We head to the cockpit, and into hyperspace

El and Ey talk
El 'You were raised disposable. There were certain disposals I ... stopped.'
El 'The list (of ppl who tried to dispose you) was long. You weren't well liked.'
Ey 'Why didn't we stay and fight (the reason for our exile?)'
El 'It was a heavily planned framing'
...
El 'I think we were trained for different things. You would've been an uncontrolable variable. But we're not equals.'
Ey 'That's the problem. You just use me.'

The job - Bracca. We've got to pick up some data from the Scrapper's Guild in Antar Felshan's pocket
- He's an up and comer, more annoying, but quite the capable killer and diplomat
- El's met them
- Savi's picking up some clearance codes from Imps on Bracca and taking them to Antar

KO meditating

- he looks back, in fear, screaming
- wakes up to the sound of savi screaming

Ey was awake, arrives to knock on Savi's door

El heads over.
KO resting on her hands, trying to breathe, whispering 'there is no emotion, there is peace'.

El slips Ey's name lmao
Ey sits in lounge. El back to bunk.
Savi returns. Compartment opens, item picked, placed back down. It sounds heavy, and metal compartment closes.
Ey goes to sleep in the workshop.

KO in the kitchen. Savi wakes early, approaches. 
KO aplogises for their presence on her ship.
Savi skeptical of how KiOn helped Ey meditate earlier.
Her curses are in Mando'a.

All of the decals on Ey's and El's pistols have been erased.
Ey sends Antar deets to El.
- a lot of plans that shouldn've have worked did work
- a problem to other syndicates

KO leads Ey through a basic kata in the bunks. Spills beans about Korith.
- Tries to encourage Ey.
Ey 'What do you do when the darkness feels consuming?'
KO 'As someone I knew said, you have to ask for help.'
Ey 'I think I need help.'

(( Scale, his team, and Korith looking out at space. K 'I think I need your help.' ))

</div></div>
 


#### 7. Easy Pickings

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





15.5.22

(( Gemar trudging through Tattoine. George sent him in the wrong direction lmao. ))

El takes droid head to workshop
Plugs it in, it comes alive
El 'This is ur promotion, ur now a general'
Puts the head in a pappoose like a dog

Ey & KO - K offers their help

K promises their aid.

Regroup - talking about where to go

next car - x3 troopers examining a box, same yellow markings
- x1 with orange pauldron and the word Monarch in Aurbesh down his left eye.

el 'we just want to help'
she leads us back into the lounge
we've got a 2nd chance

KO meditates, normal prayer to Scale and Korith
gets a reply 
- Korith 'I thought you were dead'
- KO eye's open - everything but the bunk is void, Korith sat opposite.
- Kr hurls the accusations she's been killing herself with
- he breaks the connection
Ko can sense him on the other side of the planet.
She jumps off the bed and gets Savi to leave the planet
- we head into orbit, descended on by tiefighters.

</div></div>
 


#### 8. What could (have)

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





1.06.22

(( Hut in the black mountains, drizzle outside. Stumbling towards it is a 1-armed figure with a large pot, blue and bearded. ))

El - vision
Stood in a void of stars
40ft away is Korith
- El slowly draws their pistol, starts backing away
Ey now joins the vision, close to El
- Korith is smiling, genuine joy, recognising the twins roles
Ey shoots twice, missing both, tells him to stop.
He stops.

KO appears, heads straight to him. 
Reaches out, though he flinches back.
- He wants me dead and to gain allies

He steps back into the void
- void changes into crashing waves, still stood above it
- Ey hears a heartbeat - their own 
- KO and El wearing nicer clothes, looking better
- El looks over and smiles, peacefully
Ey looks through it, back to normal, wants them as they are not as she wants them to be

Sinking through the waves, a building constructing around them
Korith at the end, twins in inquistor gear, KO nowhere to be seen.
Ey tries convincing El to drop the saber 'Why would you ever pick up a saber?'
- casts Wound on self and El

KO appears. 'Why would you do to them what they did to you?'
- he gets agitated, starts combat
- he lashes out, force push, kills el
- KO calms, Wis save, place begins to fall apart
- Korith falls, Ey catches him.

Vision switches, now a cottage at the edge of forest
- El has an orange saber

Ey's eyes open, in some forest Korith next to her
- Ey in jedi robes, Korith in dark brown and white armour with red accents, unconscious
- Ey does give life
- He wakes up, gets up
Ey 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry you didn't get a choice'
Kor 'I don't need your pity'
Ey 'This isn't pity. This is from someone else that was also made to be a monster.'
- He turns away, she backhugs
ANAKIN AND PADME THEME STARTS

KO can't sense Kor around, but senses his mixed emotions
- heads to cottage, ko supporting el
- stops when she smells baking
- she tries to see the truth
- door opens, scale there
- ko sees a soul suppressed
- el goes past for the muffins
- ko closes eyes and tries again to see the truth
-- a mistake has happened, original intention ripped aside
- ko _wants_ kor and ey here
-- they appear, now in a proper hug

el nat 1 wis
- korith now stepped back, looking at kion. 'i tried. i wanted this, but i have new masters now'
- world starts to fall apart
VADER BREATHINGS?!?!?!!
- in void again, holocron 30ft away
- hand reaches out, vader grabs it
- kion running for it, fails force disarm
- void continues to fall apart

emergency hyperspace jump

Reappear on the Jackpot
ko still has the holocron
ey checks up on savi. all good
ko sits in lounge, el and ey on other sofa
- chat about what ko knew of what happened to korith

twins head to bunk
el pulls out 0020 'i just really want him to like me'
el 'so korith, huh'
ey 'i believe he can be saved'
el 'its my fault we're being hunted. it wasn't a framing. half an hour ago, i wanted to have inherited. now, i have to think about things.'
- ey would've been at their side, even if they didn't want to be.
ey 'the crimson dawn syndicate. i met one of their younger members (Faine) on a job. it became a competition, who could outdo the other. it snowballed, but i never got to find out what could've happened. i've not heard from or even _about_ them, despite their distinct style. they just dissappeared. i've looked, since we left.'
el 'its sad how little we know about each other'
ey 'i thought you were the one who told somebody to stop me'
el 'it wasn't'
ey 'maybe i'll find out'
el 'i will help'

KO's meditating
- first on the holocron
-- holocron was touched by someone else recently
-- some, not all, of the information was taken
- what to do about it
-- ask for help
- meditates on that vision in the library
- mutters 'i need help'
-- feels the training bond once thought broken and destroyed get a response.

level up!

jackpot hits a halt
- everyone heads to the cockpit
- ko goes to fix the engines
- ey goes to fix the weapons
-- shields are minimal but okay
- el in cockpit, something starts flashing
-- they press a button, hears 'YT freighter. are you in distress?'
-- el then goes to get savi. 
-- Savi 'any aid would be appreciated'

only secondary guns are active
- el provides a status update
- el sees into savi's room, secret compartment of guns above her bed
- necklace on bedside table of the skull of an ancient creature (mythosaur)
- el finally shares their real name

ey sees a medical frigate approaching
- tractor beam of a Nebula B engages and starts to drag us in
- jackpot lands
- greeted by a dirty hangar bay with several starfighters, different models and ages and conditions.

A Doug approaches. 'you may have to go talk to Commander. I am chief engineer Ret of the Allegiance.'
Ey overheard that the flyboys are being reckless and complaining about fixing everything in time
<10 people in the hangar

El and KO go distract ret, KO recognising one of the ships as an Arc 170 - an old republic ship
Ey stealths further down. 
- left is unlocked, front locked, right is a glass door to a corridor
- overhears 'the commander knows what he's doing. I have total faith in the man. We just have to go down, do our job, then we can go back to helping people.'
- Ey heads left, to the barracks. Folks a mishmash of armor and no solid uniform. At the end is a Sullustan older man. 'All our equipment is working just fine, you're looking for the pilots.'
Ey 'I'm Ally. I'm new here.'

Ret's been working here for 4 years
- used to be an engineer for the Republic
- Currently leased to Commander Kav Narek
-- Kion recognises the name

He's meant to come down to personally inspect the Jackpot
- though he wasn't in the greatest mood

KO immediately heads to the bridge, Ey trailing behind her.
Around table, middle aged man with long brown hair and bit of a beard, short jacket, tattoos down his left arm and a cybernetic right arm, lightsaber hanging from his jacket.

(( Korith is sat in his bunks alone, staring down at his lightsaber hilt, eyes a dull blue ))

-- orange and indigo

#### 10. Escaping the Planet

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





18/6

Korith wakes, with bright blue eyes – before he was near, composed. – now he's a little messier, bit of stubble – focus adrift, looks at his hand, then his saber – tries to go back to sleep.

---

K meditating, opens eyes to see black mountains and clear blue skies – stood at the edge of a cliff – At the base is a river of magma, bright, though it seems peaceful – recognises the planet, the same spot — Sullust faltering step towards the hut – “Master?” hand on shoulder, Vesper behind her, weak and struggling force presence

Have a lovely chat – he's kinda sus? wants the 'cron – K insistent on putting the twins first

-

Twins – kyber in their hands – el lies about not having a vision – ey fakes that their crystal is whole

head towards the exist – hears footsteps, a lil muttering – light at the end of the tunnel – outer cave feels welcoming and safe

now in a large lively library – young kion runs past – hears to a younger vesper, who clocks the twins trying to stealth follow – el picks up an old book in shyriwook – ey picks up brief instructions on the construction of sabers

vesper starts to talk to them – 'i want to make sure the closest thing i have to family is safe' – 'i ask you to help bring kion to me' – 'when the temple was seiged, i tried to fight. i fought the traitor at the gate and lost. i threw everything i had at the force and ran'

twins are like ... sus bro – we heard u tho

-

back to the cave – kion stands – chat about vesper, and the crystals and their purposes – k reassures ey about the split crystals ('mine broke once as well')

head out into the worse snow – k lights saber and leads way back – ship is bured under snow – battery dead

we fight a monster – el uses lightning (dark oops)

we get comms to kav – we're on our own off the planet

we head back to the temple – k confronts el – 'until i know how u feel about the jedi and their motivation, my guidance will be limited'

ey tries meditating – korith appears infront of her k 'this is a trick, a test' e 'id rather be honest than pretending to be something im not' k 'like a jedi?' e 'i hope to be one, tho i dont know if i'll deserve it' k 'good luck with a teacher like kion' e 'sometimes its not the teacher but how you use the lessons' e 'but how are you?' k 'it doesn't matter' e 'ofc it does' k 'stop lying to me' e 'im not'

korith places his hands on her head – she lets him – his eyes go wide, he steps back

k 'you have to leave. i don't have a choice. i'm a puppet of far greater beings, and as much as I hate that, I hate other things more' e 'You've been a weapon for others. What if you choose not to be?'

Ki casts force concealment on the 'cron – meditates on vesper – they have a lovely chat bvsdbds — k 'i can't believe you thought that i would just drag them with me' — k 'we've both changed, and i don't know how.'

El rests – in a similar room, but k + ey are transparent – staircase going up — transition from natural rock to man made metal – approaches a wide hangar bat – coming out a ship is a young girl and older woman – wearing robes of one of the skeletons – walking towards ceremonial door w/ jedi symbol – they arrive in the temple main – woman sits (where we found the corpse) – el follows the padawan — sees her previous vision —– self on throne and self freeing ey —– also sees countless other young jedi —— some rewarded, some never leave

returns to real temple, side passage still open everyone awake and rested

head up the stairs, hear wind – chat about trust – there's an old rusted ship

---

corner of some shady cantina in some shithole of a planet – a puck placed before a figure – it flashes, showing the twins thrandosian 'you know how to find them' freedo draws his blaster

#### 13. Cave in!

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





23/01/23

Morning routine before heading out to meet Captn Torn at the mines
twins aren't talking to each other after the korith conversation last night

torn along w/ five people - mismatched looks, worn equipment, crudely drawn logos of multiple crime organisations, either noobs or locals
pesk - trandosian big guy 
tikka - twilek small sassy woman
yeller - mon calamari fish guy w/ bulbous eyes, sniper rifle
will - quarren fish guy with tendrils, rotary gun
chuck - guy in shitty poor faceless armour w/ signs of _so_ many gangs, poorly held rifle

we are going by lorelai (ey), franky the mad man (el), kion

sent some guards ahead, not reported back
10k credits split between 8

head to elevator
chuck drew the symbols on himself, to be approachable to these guys so they'd hire him
- fanboy in the way that he saw his older brother play a game and now its his favourite video game ever

arrive at bottom of tunnel
they dont want us here - think they could do it themselves

ey w/ chuck, el w/ will, k w/ pesk

twins hear shuffling super far down, occasional cracking and crunching sound
k feels like someone is straining nearby in the force - light use

tikka sees a large crack running the length of the cave towards the elevator
ey knows this is not a natural cave in - its the force, manipulated around the group as a whole

we start running
walls are cracking, cracks start splitting, intensifying between the two groups
cracks are fine further back, its worst right beneath and behind us
floor gives way - slide down into a warm liquid that cushions the floor

now in a dark cave system
ey hears shuffling, like feet being dragged
two groups separate
k feels that lingering force presence from the centre of the cave
dead bodies lingering in the corridors and half-submerged
from uniform and fresh blood - these are the miners who have gone missing

all step into the water
k feels the pressure return - not on the environment but on _us_ - now dark?
grabbing onto you, squeezing, pulling the life away
the sensation washes away, into the water
the bodies begin to twitch
zombies rise

roll initiative
el uses lightning

make it out and through
follow the force presence
creature on a elevated part of the floor - large damaged hooded brown robe, face obscured, dripping, staring at us three

k: who are you?
figure reaches into its chest, revealing an orange, slightly blackened hand, nails grown and dirty
pulls out a lightsaber - one half damaged, scarred, sparking - other side erupts an orange blade
illuminates his face - two horns but one is gone, large scar down his face, missing an eye
