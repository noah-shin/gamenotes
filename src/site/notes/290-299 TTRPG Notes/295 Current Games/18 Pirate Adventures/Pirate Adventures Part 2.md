Room is a big cavern - no way out
No-one crushed the alarm on the outside
Lucy is no longer with us
Someone passed through this room semi-recently

Head in
Doors closing behind us
Braziers flicker on as we walk in
Walks covered in books, strange artifacts on the table
Moving painting on the wall
Lever book, shelf moves, painting falls, water fills the room

Run through corridor
Kappa room
Corridor of blades
Have to sacrifice blood
