# Description

Sworn to the Water; watch of the Weeping Waters.

Ilfar would be on the council (with how much power/wealth they have, having complete control of nilwelv's water supply) if not for their current (and strangely, seemingly always and forever) lack of female children.

Cursed with only male children.

Adopt new Matrons - those drawn to the Waters. The Waters have a strange ‘pull’ - be it through the influence of the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild\|Feywild]] above or the [[Faerzress\|Faerzress]] below (_who knows_). Adoption process is highly secretive.
