# Building

## Spire

Where [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ulvyr\|Ulvyr]] resides, where he and his do their wizardly work.
It's warped with foul necromantic magic, separated from the rest of the house.

Steel doors at the entrance, cursing all those who enter unwelcome.

The hallways are quite, other than the sound of something dripping.
There are many figures chained to the walls - those dead, dying, and long dead.

Six floor - Supply room
Seventh - Morgue
Either - Main lab and space for classes
