# Blessing

**Silken Weaver's Sight**
The ability to see into the future and weave it to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lolth\|Lolth]]'s Will.
The extent of their Sight is unknown.

They divine the future in these large, circular looms spun with silk (and in looms in general - smaller looms, y-shaped looms they keep on their person to divine the more immediate future).

They draw their Sight from celestials / fae (which [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Elag\|Elag]] discovered. Uncertain if the looms are legit or just for show.
