# Description

Raiders from the Demonweb Pits; delivered from the Pits to carve the will of Lolth on the World Above.

They recently rose to prominence - roughly at the same pace as the rising tensions between Nilwelv and the world above; very ambitious.

Very unabashedly trying to shoulder their way onto the council, v promising candidates.

They chaperone the [[Blooding\|Blooding]].

They're known for being a very close family, not into the whole backstabbing thing, which is very rare in drow society.
