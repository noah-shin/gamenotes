# Building

Most physically imposing house

Hooked at the top, bridge stretching over a pit 'to the Abyss', spiked archway, two spiked towers both lit w/ fires that never go out

Long red & gold banners slumped over the walls, pits of fire along the path, spider stables along one side.

# Blessing

Helps them conjure demons, makes them intimidating and charismatic.
