# Description

# Relationships

# History

During the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Hallowing\|Hallowing]], the original Matron - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Aliya\|Aliya]] - sacrificed her family for the Blessing - Dominion.
Her daughter [[La'rael\|La'rael]] survived, hidden, and also inherited the Blessing.

# Building

Most physically imposing house

A great wall, bowed in and hooked with spikes; a sharply curved bridge stretching over a pit into The Abyss; a spiked archway, two spiked towers on either side - lit with a roaring fire that never goes out. Iron gates bearing the House Desor sigil mark the entrance.

Beyond the wall, a great stone castle; long, gaudy red and gold bearing the House Desor sigil; pits with crackling fire on either side of a wide path through the courtyard; giant spiders held in the long stables to the left.

# Blessing

Helps them conjure demons, makes them intimidating and charismatic.
