# History

# Building

The entrance hall is shallow and smells of cold leather and ink.
The hallways are all lined with heavy black tomes of differing wear.
A tall door with two simple staircases that lead to a landing with two more doors - the House and the Library.

The library has arcane symbols carved into these archways in the walls.

One hallway has a silk tapestry preserved in glass, depicting the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Hallowing\|Hallowing]].
