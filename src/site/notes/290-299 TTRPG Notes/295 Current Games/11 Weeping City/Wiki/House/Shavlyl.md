# Description

House Shavlyl is the most unstable House on the Council.

Servants of the Sword.

# Blessing

Blessed by the Fleshcarver, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lolth\|Lolth]] - masters in swordcraft and swordsmanship, wielding strange, adamantine swords and a vast, secret knowledge of ancient drow sword arcana.

They are cursed with the Fleshcarverâ€™s bloodlust and bound permanently to their blades. 

# History

It's speculated that the previous Matron - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Irayrr\|Irayrr]] - was killed because she took a high elf consort.

# Building

The most simple in design, it opens with a great, adamantine gate - simple, with the House Shavlyl sigil worked into it.

Beyond the gate is a heavily guarded courtyard, and a pair of curling staircases that lead to a large archway, with another gate, and a looming silver door.

The building has two round towers on either side, with two larger towers behind it.

The corridor is lined with the swords from the previous Matron Mother's.

The training room has a wall that is just a window looking over the [[Weeping Waters\|Weeping Waters]], and the opposite wall is made of mirrors.
