# Description

Servants of the Sword.

Blessed by the Fleshcarver, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lolth\|Lolth]] - masters in swordcraft and swordsmanship, wielding strange, adamantine swords and a vast, secret knowledge of ancient drow sword arcana.

# History

The previous Matron - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Irayrr\|Irayrr]] was killed because she took a high elf consort.

# Building

The most simple in design, it has two round towers on either side, with two larger towers behind it, and a looming silver door above a curling pair of staircases.

The corridor is lined with the swords from the previous Matron Mother's.

The training room has a wall that is just a window looking over the [[Weeping Waters\|Weeping Waters]], and the opposite wall is made of mirrors.
