# Building

Smallest house - looking smaller still in the looming shadow of House Maytyl behind it; set in a jagged, craggy pit 50 ft. down in the cavern floor; two guards in red plate; a single, stone staircase - lined with sharp, jutting rocks and tall, black lanterns burning white with black-tinged flames - leading down into a thin, red fog

Large, funnel shaped, fallen stalactite like a spike with three smaller, spiked stalactites spaced unevenly around it - cracked with red; black flames in the small, open windows

The air is thick with magic - cloying, you can almost taste it, coppery. 

At the bottom of the staircase - the bottom of the pit - is a round courtyard, circled with black lanterns; a row of lanterns leading to the largest  fallen stalactite - the house proper.
