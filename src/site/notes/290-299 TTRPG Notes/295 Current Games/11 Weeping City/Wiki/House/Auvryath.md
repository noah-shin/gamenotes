## Dragon Shard

Common myth - shard is the ghost of a dragon

When a gem dragon dies, some of its mind stays behind as a psychic remnant.
It's usually left in big rocks that were a part of its hoard.

# History

-? - When Nilwelv was still [[Orthel\|Orthel]], House Auvryath settled here.

0 - The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Hallowing\|Hallowing]]. 
Peace was falsely observed.

Auvryath had ties to three great dragons and were getting all this knowledge of ancient draconic magics (forbidden in the lolthite society la'val, desor and shavlyl were starting to build).
Auvryath also held kobolds and other draconic races in high esteem - something very weird and not tolerated by ur average drow.

With their draconic ties, however, they were too powerful to attack outright.

36xx - The Auvryath usupring was brewing for decades; houses [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]], [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] slowly swayed (maybe a little meaner than swayed) the other council and noble houses in support. 
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]] didn’t involve themselves as much as they could’ve - they certainly weren’t the least involved (that would’ve been [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Lirast\|Lirast]], who protested the usurping the most (and v nearly were usurped themselves)), but they didn’t, e.g., offer their services to la’val as they had with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Elag\|Elag]]. 

The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]] watched the House for decades - infiltrating and learning the ins and outs - before sending a small troupe after the dragons.
They consisted of the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/High Weaver\|High Weaver]], a number of Weavers, and many Web Spinners and Spiders.

Only the High Weaver and one Weaver (who has since left the DMH) returned.
