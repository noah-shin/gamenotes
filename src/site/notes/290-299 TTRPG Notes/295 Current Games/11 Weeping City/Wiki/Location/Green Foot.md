#location #inn 

A tavern made entirely of wood - strangely unaffected by rot. Glossy, light green mushrooms sprout from the mud around the tavern, between the wooden slats. A wooden sign with a dull, gold border nailed to the wall beside the door - ‘Greenfoot’s’ in dull, gold paint.

A long place of wood, with no rot - unlike the rest of the city.

Decent looking place, more mid-tier than lower.

Bright red mushrooms decorate the place.

Everyone who works here looks sickly, with glowing green eyes and mushrooms growing out their face.

The barkeep is human, with a very strangled voice.
