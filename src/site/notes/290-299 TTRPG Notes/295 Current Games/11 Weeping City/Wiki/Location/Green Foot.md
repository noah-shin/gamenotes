#location #inn 

A long place of wood, with no rot - unlike the rest of the city.

Decent looking place, more mid-tier than lower.

Bright red mushrooms decorate the place.

Everyone who works here looks sickly, with glowing green eyes and mushrooms growing out their face.

The barkeep is human, with a very strangled voice.
