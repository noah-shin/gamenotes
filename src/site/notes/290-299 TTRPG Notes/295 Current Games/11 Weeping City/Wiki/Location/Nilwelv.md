## Weeping Waters

## Amrinti - Upper Nilwelv

Home of the most powerful, wealthy noble Houses.

To climb the stairs up from Nyndinla, it costs 4GP.

Amrinti is a grand and striking level, full of marvels of stone, crystal and magic.

The few buildings here all belong to those of the Council, their stonework integrated into the natural stalagmites, stalactites and cave columns. The average passer-by, not that there are many up here, might not how impractical their architecture is, with a strong reliance on magic to reinforce them.

### Ardulae

Elegance to the point of extremity, Ardulae is stark, empty, and imposing.

> [!info]-  Ruling Council Chambers
> Built into a cave column.

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] Ruins
> A prominent sight from the levels below, the charred cobblestone walls still glinting with crystals, the smoking crumbling pillars and archways have been preserved in time - of the moment of their destruction.
> 
> The haunting living quarters of the Auvryath children, the stone tower is still smoking, the foundations of the smaller towers around cracked in half, its three stone floors and staircases horribly exposed. Half a roof, crumbling, its spire a rough spike.

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]]
> Looming over the rest of the city, and casting a shadow over the Auvryath ruins opposite, 

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Ilfar\|Ilfar]]


> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]]
> The most physically imposing building on the upper level, the most that people can see of the Desor building is its great wall, bowed in and hooked with spikes, the sharply curved bridge that stretches over a pit into the Abyss, and a spiked archway, two spiked towers on either side that are lit with a roaring fire that never goes out, and the iron gates bearing the House Desor sigil that marks the entrance.
> 
> Within the wall is a great stone castle, long, gaudy red and gold bearing the House Desor sigil; pits with crackling fire on either side of a wide path through the courtyard; giant spiders held in the long stables to the left.

#### House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]]
> The most simple in design, the building opens with a great, adamantine gate, with the House Shavlyl sigil worked into it.
> 
> Beyond the gate is a heavily guarded courtyard, and a pair of curling staircases that lead to a large archway, with another gate, and a looming silver door.
> 
> The building has two round towers on either side, with two larger towers behind it.

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]]

> [!info]- Mols Stalactites
> Caging House Arcice is a dense stalactite forest, where stone drips from the cavern ceiling and nearly reach the floor, giving the impression of a shadowed forest. Amongst the stone trees, the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Nilwelv Plants#Blue Drop Cups\|Nilwelv Plants#Blue Drop Cups]] grow most abundantly.

### Elggedir

The second emptiest sub-district, another stalactite forest spans the space, though less dense than the one to the east. 

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]]
> Loosely caged in with stalactites, the House is a large black spire that scrapes the cavern ceiling, surrounded by a rough cage of stalactites connected to the spire by ropey, calcified web suspension bridges.
> 
> One such suspension bridge leads to another nearby spire, where the House Wizard resides, warped with foul necromantic magic, separated from the rest of the house. There are steel doors at the entrance, cursing all those who enter unwelcome.

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Elag\|Elag]] Ruins
> Ruined buildings built in-between the stalactites, they are cracked and overgrown, now barely distinguishable from the stone forest around them.

## Nyndinla - Mid Nilwelv

Home of (all other) noble Houses, mid- and upper-class commoners and the most successful businesses. 

To climb the stairs up from Arl'she, it costs 1GP.

Here the houses are built of stone, covered in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Nilwelv Plants#Black Bark Mushrooms\|Nilwelv Plants#Black Bark Mushrooms]]. There is magic here, though much less.

### Aunelis

The emptiest area within all Nilwelv, Aunelis acts as the city's un(official) graveyard - as most bodies are composted and/or taken out of the city due to a lack of space.

The shadows here are unnerving, with subconscious whispers and the constant sensation of being watched.

> [!info]- Aunelis Square
> A small-ish courtyard that hasn't been stepped on by a living being since memory here began.

### Elvila
Home of most of the minor noble houses.

> [!info]- Elk'la Market
> A courtyard of surprisingly nice shops, the market is built around an amethyst water fountain in its centre.

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Maytyl\|Maytyl]]

> [!info]- House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]]
> The smallest building, it looks smaller still with the looming shadow of House Maytyl behind it. 
> 
> Set in a jagged, craggy pit fifty foot deep in the cavern floor, all that can bee seen from the entrance would be two guards in red plate and a single, stone staircase - lined with sharp, jutting rocks and tall, black lanterns burning white with black-tinged flames - leading down into a thin, red fog. 
> 
> The building is a large, funnel shaped, fallen stalactite like a spike with three smaller, spiked stalactites spaced unevenly around it - cracked with red; black flames in the small, open windows.
> 
> The air is thick with magic - cloying, you can almost taste it, coppery. 
> 
> At the bottom of the staircase - the bottom of the pit - is a round courtyard, circled with black lanterns; a row of lanterns leading to the largest  fallen stalactite - the house proper.

> A large stone temple, with a strangely, starkly open plan and large archways.
> 
> Grand stone stairs lead to open archways that lead into the house.

### Erendor

Home of the wealthiest and most successful merchants, it houses the occasional storefront.

The space is incredibly neat and geometric, almost in defiance of the cavern system the city is built in, with a wide main road, where neat side roads branch off.

### Tar'threl

The landscape is rocky, covered in stretches of rough stalagmites like spires, sprouting with fungi and raw minerals.

It is rich and bright, cast in the electric blue light of Mols Stalactites above.

> [!info]- Body Pit
> Among all the bright flora, tucked in a small collection of darker stalagmites, darker fungi - directly beneath House Shavlyl is an opening, a collapsed cave floor that gives way to a funnelled hole in the ground. 
> 
> The pit likely collapsed from the weight of armoured bodies falling from the great heights above, and is piled with bodies in varying stages of decomposition and decay.

## Arl'she - Lower Nilwelv

Arl’she (Lower Nilwelv) - home of mid- and lower-class commoners, and most businesses.

The houses are made of stone or damp, cave-rotted wood, all covered in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Nilwelv Plants#Black Bark Mushrooms\|Nilwelv Plants#Black Bark Mushrooms]]. There is little magic present here.

### Shelith

A sub-district in Arl’she; the poorest sub-district, populated by sick, disfigured and/or disgraced drow and most of Nilwelv’s non-drow inhabitants. 

Stone floors, cobbled and crumbling; crumbling stalagmites and large rocks, hollowed out. Crowded, stone houses, stacked, cracks filled with mud dredged from the Weeping Waters. Some houses built entirely from mud. Wooden doors, window frames, tables, chairs - rotted through; cloth where doors and windows had rotted. Wet. Clotheslines strung across narrow walkways. Cloth tent houses. Wooden houses and roofs. Lanterns filled with yellow, bioluminescent mushrooms, candles. Little to no magic.

> [!info]- [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Illien Spires\|Illien Spires]]
> Two stalagmites that edge Shelith, they hold job boards for the lower city.

> [!info]- Kobold Community
> Left of Renri's Green Foot Inn, down a thin, rocky track, following the wall, you can find hollowed out rocks, stalagmites - half-crumbling, tops all cracked off and smoking. The stalagmites are all connected - rocks pushed between them, hollowed out into short tunnels. 
> 
> Here, at the far end of Shelith; at the cave wall between the two city walls, where the stalagmites get thicker, is a small kobold community. Founded by the remnants of House Auvryath and their faithful followers, the hollowed out stalagmites give way to a shallow series of tunnels in the cave wall.

> [!info]- Shelith Market
> Directly below Aunelis, to an opening in the crowded houses where you see a small market and an even smaller collection of buildings - Green Foot and the Blue Bottle.

> [!info]- Shelith Slums
> Closest to the Weeping Waters are a collection of tents. Close to the outer-wall, they spill out into Ekel.

### Renri

A sub-district in Arl’she; the industrial sub-district of Nilwelv, where most exports are manufactured. 

Very industrial. Mushroom farms, spider farms. Stalagmites - tall, hollowed out and reinforced (stone, black bark mushroom), factories for food, armour, swords, poisons, silks, spiders.

Entering Renri, you pass great, steel-reinforced stalagmites - factories, feeding dark smoke into holes carved into the cavern ceiling.

> [!info]- Spider Farms
> Directly beneath Elvila, giant spiders are hoisted up via a pulley system over the wall.

### Intra

A sub-district in Arl’she; home of mid-class commoners

> [!info]- The Wyrds
> A labyrinthine market, the Wyrds bisect Arl'she, through Intra and Ekel. It stretches all the way to the city gates, where small pop-up stalls try to catch the flow of people coming in/going out of the city.
> 
> It splits off into houses, shops (restaurants etc).

> [!info]- [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Church of Lolth\|Church of Lolth]]
> A looming spire- made of black marble, glinting with crystals - amethyst, obsidian - branching off into a confusing web of smaller spires; long, crystal windows.

> [!info]- The Crescent
> Nilwelv's theatre district.
> 
> A bespoke C-shaped collection of small shops, taverns, all coming off on either side from the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Ivory Theatre\|Ivory Theatre]] - a great, open-roofed theatre made of glowing, white bone. 
> 
> To the right of The Ivory theatre is a black tavern - an imitation of a keep. In shimmering, silver cursive on a sign hanging out on an iron rod- The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Dark Keep\|Dark Keep]].

### Ekel
