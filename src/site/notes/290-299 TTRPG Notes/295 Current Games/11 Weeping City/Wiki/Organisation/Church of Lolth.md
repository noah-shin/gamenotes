# Building 

A gorgeous lavish building.

Spiralling staircases, no backdoor.
One hall has a lavish mural with a history of the city.

The Church has a large room of ever-changing looms divining the future of Nilwelv (tended to by [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ilvir\|Ilvir]] ). 

The largest loom - the loom divining the [[Prophecy\|Prophecy]] of the dark war - is only seen and tended to by the Matron mother - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]].
