#lore #timeline 

Time amongst the drow is relative to The Hallowing.

After surface elves took their city, the surviving members of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]], House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] and House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] sought [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lolth\|Lolth]] in the [[Demonweb Pits\|Demonweb Pits]] for Blessings to ensure the survival of the drow from further surface elf raids.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Aliya\|Aliya]] - the then-Matron of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] - called upon and communed with yochlols across the [[Abyss\|Abyss]] to navigate the three houses through the Pits.

In the Pits, her magics failed and the Houses became lost in the [[Infinite Web\|Infinite Web]].

As a show of faith, the Matrons from each House (Aliya, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Llar'as\|Llar'as]], and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Ine\|Ine]]) sacrificed what was left their own to be shown the way to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lolth\|Lolth]]. They were shown to the iron citadel atop which Lolth stands and given Blessings. 

(This gift is known as the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Hallowing\|Hallowing]])

Through her Blessing of Sight, Ilarâ€™as (La'val Matron at the time) was shown that [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv\|Nilwelv]] was where the surface elves would make their first and final advance on the Underdark (something the drow refer to as [[The Dark War\|The Dark War]]).
