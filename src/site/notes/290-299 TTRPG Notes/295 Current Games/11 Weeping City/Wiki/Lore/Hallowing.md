#lore #timeline 

Time amongst the drow is relative to The Hallowing.

After surface elves took their city, the surviving members of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]], House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] and House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] sought [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lolth\|Lolth]] in the [[150-200 Notes/151 Archive/2022 Notes/11 Weeping City/11.02 Wiki/006. Lore/Big Locations/Demonweb Pits\|Demonweb Pits]] for Blessings to ensure the survival of the drow from further surface elf raids.

In the Pits, they became lost in the [[150-200 Notes/151 Archive/2022 Notes/11 Weeping City/11.02 Wiki/006. Lore/Big Locations/Infinite Web\|Infinite Web]] and, as a show of faith, the Matron's from each House sacrificed what was left their own to be shown the way to Lolth. They were shown to the iron citadel atop which Lolth stands and given Blessings. 
(This gift is known as the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Hallowing\|Hallowing]])

Through her Blessing of Sight, Ilarâ€™as xund Ana of House La'val (Matron at the time) was shown that [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv\|Nilwelv]] was where the surface elves would make their first and final advance on the Underdark (something the drow refer to as [[The Dark War\|The Dark War]]).
