#person 

A stark white mask with a painted smiling face.
Has two long white braids, and curved swords with cutouts.

Allowed to operate outside the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]]
Which is weird, because the DMH are controlled by [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]].
	When La'val want a hit, but don't want it traced through the DMH, they ask her.
