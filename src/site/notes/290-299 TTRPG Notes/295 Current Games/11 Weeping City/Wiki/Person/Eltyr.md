# Eltyr klug [[Aryn\|Aryn]] of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Elag\|Elag]]

The patron and consort of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]]

Taken in a year before [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Elag\|Elag]] were usurped, he currently thinks he was the only one left alive in the House usurpation, by virtue of his new house.

However, his House falling linked to a fall from his own new rise, suspicious for how short he was here before, and is now kept alive but on a very short leash.
