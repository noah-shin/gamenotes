# Personality

Takes pride and honestly thrives in their role - they love the fear and power and prestige and recognition and all the rest of it that they hold but at the same time cannot help but resent it because it was created as a prison and a form of control over them.

No brooding no transition to adulthood nothing there it's just .... one phase to the next and this next has also just been so stagnant

They put the mask on and froze in place and time and never ... became their own person, never experienced this life of others

Its just power and knowledge and position and burning desire that's always tempered by their absolute rigidity.

# Backstory

Theirs is a house - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Elag\|Elag]], third son and third daughter, and theirs is a name, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Llar'gent\|Llar'gent]], gold rings and thick gold lip-stick.

They're thirty, a child, a secretary, when Elag finally establishes itself as a noble house, built on shadows and whispers, on secrets ferried from clerks and servant, on their whispered spells and hidden runes.

Mother tells them, secrets like this aren't allowed to get out.

They're fourty-two and they tell Uss'lyn a rumour they've tugged on until the end of the thread. She's their eldest sister, one whom lets Llar'gent tuck themself into her side, one who has visions of a certain mother's death. So they tell her of a certain House's Sight, and Uss'lyn uses that thread to tie tight a noose.

They're fourty-two and they're third-born and they're the only clerk left, secret-keeper and secret-finder, and they look up to see a phantom holding a sword dripping red against their neck.

They're fourty-two and their lipstick has long rubbed off.

They're fourty-two and they're buried alive in darkness.

They're fourty-two and -

They meet [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lady Lara'el\|Lady Lara'el]]. And now -

Theirs is a House - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]], and theirs is a second-hand name - Eosphorus. Morning-star, light, dawn. Theirs is a role, theirs is a mask, theirs is a watchful eye.

They're 150 and there's a mask on their face. But still their work hasn't changed, diplomat or threat or information-gatherer just titles. They are a secret-trafficker, speech-writer, form-in-triplicate-maker.

They're 410 and they've never had a [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Rites and Rituals#Blooding\|Rites and Rituals#Blooding]], never seen the surface, never known a _life_ for their own. They've never had anything but this _want_, a bleeding broken desire that all they've been taught is to name it Revenge.
