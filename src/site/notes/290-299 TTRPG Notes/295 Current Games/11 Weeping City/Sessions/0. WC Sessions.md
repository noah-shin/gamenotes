# Weeping City

Drow politics, and a fracturing Underdark. 

The thought-dead daughter of House Shalvyly, Sasrene (Lauren), the thought-last part of usurped House Aurvrayath, Garlick (Vinnie), the now-dead son of House Shalvyly, Atton, the not-quite-human woman Martha (Jake), and the mysterious diplomat of House Dog'hymn, Eosphorous (Noah), gather for one purpose: 

To gain their ultimate desires, and to see House La'val fall.
