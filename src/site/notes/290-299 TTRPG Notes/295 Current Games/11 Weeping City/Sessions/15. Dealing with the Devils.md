Garlick, after casting the parrots, was yanked back by the coat into nothing.
After 5 minutes, they are pushed back into the room, out of nothing, looking stunned.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Saba\|Saba]] Desor is helped out by two guards; dressed in a rich, red robe with gold detail and a strange, gold fur trim; you think you see something - a shadow crawl at her feet. She smiles at you fiendishly. She is followed out of the carriage by the House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] weaponmaster [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erynyl\|Erynyl]], two handmaids, and two more House Desor guards.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]] [[La’val\|La’val]] seems to float out of the carriage; followed by four handmaids. She smiles softly, looking down at you. Dressed in an intricate web dress. In her hand, an ornate, gold quarterstaff, the top curved into a wide Y shape and spun with silvery webs. Behind her, led out on a thin golden chain in Faeryl’s hand, is the Patron of La’val, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eltyr\|Eltyr]] La’val. A shell of a man.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atrys\|Atrys]] [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] steps out with little fanfare, accompanied by two guards: the youngest matron, never dressed in more than a loose white shirt, pants and simple, black knee-high boots; her hair in a loose braid over her shoulder. A thin, silver chain around her neck bearing the House Shavlyl sigil. Her face is neutral, bored; her pale, silver eyes scan you passively. 

Sas isn't wearing her contacts or wig, wearing DMH gear but with Shavlyl weapons on show.
Atrys _does_ recognise her.
Sas gives a lil wave.
Atrys just looks past her, pretending she isn't there.

As Fae steps out, looking out at us, it feels like something cold is in the air, like a hundred eyes are looking at the group, like a presence is behind and above at the same time.

Behind her, for a moment, are two ghostly looking figures
- one is a woman tinged gold, a hand wrapped around the quarterstaff
- one is a person tinged blue, face obscured by a waterfall of hair

faeryl, in her usual whisper - are you all going to come out, or do we need to come in?
sasrene - that depends. are we talking, or should we be prepared
faeryl - to talk. i just don't want to waste my breath
sasrene - may i ask the rest before inviting you in?
faeryl - .... why not

---

sas to martha - can you get the others?
sas to eos over the earring - platin'ust, do you want to be revealed?

matrons are already unusually tense between them
though presenting a united front

we all come out to the door, leaving no-name w/ vyrek
fabia sees a shadow under the webbing, in the crawlspace
sas notices them, sees multiple assassins of the DMH dotted around, most under the webbing
- two of them are sas' lil spiderlings - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ylda\|Ylda]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Minelv\|Minelv]]
- look to be here to do a job
- also hears the distinct rattling of chains of a high weaver

faeryl - all of you to come out
sas motions martha forward slightly
faeryl - its not that much surprises me, but was does is your stupidity.
f - if not for my sight ..
eos silently scoffs
f to eos - and who are you really?

eos drops disguise self to become llargent
eltyr gasps
eos - hi uncle. i cannot say im glad to see you're still alive
he goes to speak, but f's hand on the leash silences him instantly

sas - how is your youngest? I heard she was gifted.
faeryl - she's currently in her studies, and is going to be a wonderful protege

atrys to faeryl - i will accept any punishment for my indiscretion, but i ask that it happens after we settle the heritage of the house shavlyl
fae accepts
sas - ah, but you might want to hear this
sas - do you know of her son, who you allowed to live in this city, and his connection to certain turmoil here
atrys - we have, i think, isolated the main players: my son and the current weaponmaster have been killed, as of this morning

fae to fabia - do i know you?
fabia flashes a glance at saba
saba - oh, she's nothing more than a handmaiden. she'll be dealt with accordingly
saba motions her forward

fabia steps towards saba
faeryl holds up a hand
fae to saba - you didn't know about this, did you?
saba - of course not! as i said, she'll be dealt with 

ernyly steps forward, saba immediately stops him
faeryl - they'll all be coming with me, to house la'val. i would prefer if you all came without much conflict, but i will be taking you to house la'val, for further official proceedings

none of them have glowing white

laval with a sigil, brooch, weapons, all glow
faeryl's quarterstaff is glowing with divine? celestial? 
saba giving off enchantment and conjuration vibes
abjuration around the carriages, especially the space at the back to restrain us

---

eos - you follow this liar? claiming to be the envoy of a god she likely has never met, instead in league with the celestials, with the fae? you're both pathetic
saba turns to faeryl - is this true?
silence in answer

faeryl doesn't look at her, and saba drops to her knees, and her skin starts to bubble and blister, as though she was caught in the sunlight, holding back a scream until she can't anymore
faeryl to saba, not looking - don't question me.

fae - are you coming with us, or are we going to be bringing you with us?
garlick counterspells the daylight
fabia casts cure wounds on saba 
> ernyl stood above them both, protective, wary of faeryl
