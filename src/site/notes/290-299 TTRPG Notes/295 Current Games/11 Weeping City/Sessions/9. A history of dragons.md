#session 

Garlick wakes up and starts looking around.

Sas drags [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vieren\|Vieren]] inside - the floor above Garlick.

Outside, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Minelv\|Minelv]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ylda\|Ylda]] are watching.
Sas heads to them.

M - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Elen'y\|Elen'y]] sent us to watch you
S - What happened in those 5 hours?
M - You seemed to be laughing about something a lot, and asking about the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] uprising.
M - Anything more, we need 15GP
Sas gives it
M - You seemed to be asking a lot about the dragons.

---

Garlick peeps its eyes out the top of the trapdoor
Spots Vieren and goes into a Panik

---

M - The name was [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erzel\|Erzel]]. You asked a lot of questions and the High Priestess left after that.
S - Elen'y doesn't have the authority to send you after me.

Sas tells them to leave, then heads back to the safehouse.

Garlick goes for a hug with Vieren
G - Are you a ghost? Am I dead?
S - Please calm down, this needs to be a secret.

They all head downstairs.

S - Vieren, why are you here?
V - I think it's time House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] takes back the city. We've received word from a trusted source in House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Lirast\|Lirast]] that there is a [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath#Dragon Shard\|Auvryath#Dragon Shard]] in the city.

V - It's believed to be a shard of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erzel\|Erzel]]. If we're able to resurrect ... 
V - I need to get in touch with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vyrek\|Vyrek]]

S - Have you considered what this might mean ... for me?
V - I have extremely complicated feelings about you
S - I literally went against my orders to save you, to save [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lyra\|Lyra]].

G - Garlick is in charge now! Why were you talking about the dragons?
S - I was discussing our missing five hours
V - ?
G - Who even are you?!

S - Let me explain. I used to be the eldest daughter of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]]. The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]] saved my life, so when I was told to take out the young ones of Auvryath, I infiltrated the House as a servant.
S - I sent my spiders after a fake lead so I could get the young ones out, but I said I killed them.
S - I took them to a surface elf, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erro\|Erro]], who got them out on a pirate ship by [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Captain Ara\|Captain Ara]]. 
S - If it was discovered that I lied, I would be hunted and killed as a message.
S - ... I understand if you want to hit me.
V - ... That Shavlyl stuff was new to me.

Sas takes off her wig and contacts.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Davina\|Davina]] is staring at us with burning white eyes.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Anora\|Anora]] is behind the desk, better at hiding how mad she is.

Anora to Fabia - You've been requested to return to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]], Andry.
Fabia is strangely quiet, and flinches at the name, before following them out.

Martha and Eos also hustle out
See troops heading towards [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Ekel\|Nilwelv#Ekel]] market

M - We should rest. I have a place in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Tar’threl\|Nilwelv#Tar’threl]].
Eos declines for now.

---

Head to the market, as it hits closing time.
Eos in disguise as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#JC\|Eos' Aliases#JC]].
Meets [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Hazel\|Hazel]] as the fae shop is closing up.

H - I live in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Silver Spring\|Silver Spring]]. Had to travel to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild\|Feywild]] to get some of these things. 
H - The path to the Feywild is only accessible on a full moon, dive into the lake and you will enter [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild#Arshee\|Feywild#Arshee]].
H - The stories I've been hearing, power in Arshee is shifting.
H - The domain is currently ruled by the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]] - the High Queen of the Ice Mountain.
H - There's been talks of the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Weeping Maiden\|Weeping Maiden]] returning to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Oron Aia\|Oron Aia]] to restore it to how it was before the elves.
H - The WM claims the waters of the mountain as her own, wanting to kill everyone, wipe the slate clean, both above and below.
H - Both domains are over winter.
H - The drow are pillaging elvish settlements, so the weapons could've come from the fae, though I don't understand why either would give weapons. 

---

Garlick - You saved my family, so ... I forgive you.

Sas goes to their chest, and pulls out a necklace of brushed glass, with a lovely chain and gem.
S - This was my mother's. It's all I have left of her.

Sas gives it to Garlick.
Garlick pulls out a silver goblet and a metal bracelet engraved with 'T + N' for Sas.
Gives a bent fork to Vieren.

S - Vieren, if you're ever spotted, that's an instant hit on me. Be careful.
G - If you die, I'll kill you!

V - You can find me at the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Black Web Inn\|Black Web Inn]]
Then heads off.

---

Garlick's left leg buckles, the wound turned black and brittle.

Sas picks them up, and heads to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Tilly\|Tilly]].
She applies a paste, slowing the freezing.

T - This is fae magic, my balms can only do so much.
T - I know of a salve that could work to cure this fae sickness. Get the ingredients from the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]] apocathery in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Ekel\|Nilwelv#Ekel]].

T whispers to S - Garlick has four hours, tops.
