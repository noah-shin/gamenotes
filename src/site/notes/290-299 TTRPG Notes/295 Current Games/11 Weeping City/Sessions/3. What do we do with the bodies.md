[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kato\|Kato]] unfastens their cloak to grab a weapon - which is glowing white like our hands.

K - Your money or your life.
Sas - You understand what this means, right? [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Cutter\|Cutter]] will hear.
K - You haven't heard? Cutter's out, there's a bounty on his head.
S - You're not as good as him.

We continue heading to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Green Foot\|Green Foot]] - passing through Renri, then Shelith.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Martel\|Eos' Aliases#Martel]] offers Garlick a piggy back.
It jumps off once we get into Shelith, and begins acting very proper.

Arriving in Green Foot, Garlick recognises [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Tilly\|Tilly]].
G takes S and F to get healed.
	Tilly averts eyes from any drow

We get a backroom.
Everyone states why they don't like [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]].

Eos casts Detect Magic and senses:

S -
	A small, winged figure, tucked behind her hair; glowing a faint purple with conjuration magics, flecked with strange, shifting white swirls and threads of colour, like the Northern Lights.
	Rapier on her hip glows black and grey with necromancy magics.

A -
	The gaudy House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] insignia on his gauntlet glows faintly with too many different magics to clearly discern.
	Glaive on his back glows black and grey with necromancy magics.

F -
	Jeremy glows purple with conjuration magics.

G -
	The blue ring around one of Garlick’s fingers glows a bright purple with conjuration magics; the aura seems unstable - pulsing.
	Something from within Garlick’s coat - key-shaped, tucked away - glows a faint purple with conjuration magics.

Other -
	The table is fashioned out of a glossy, green mushroom between the beds, and glows black and grey with necromancy magics.

Eos drops Alter Self
E - Well, that was exhausting
