#session 

Eos' reveal is not ... well received.

A and S are glaring.
S goes to leave.
F convinces her back (E isn't worth you leaving vibes)

E exchanges a truth in exchange for the deception, in order for everyone to move on.

S wants to know about the 'Eant' from the fight.
E - It's Elant
A - How is the mask shiny?
E - It's magic.
A - How does it work?
E - It's magic.
F - Do you have any secrets on House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]]?
	E picks up that they need help on something, but cannot ask outright
E - Desor was nearly destroyed recently due to an attempted uprising.

SECRET - E also knows that [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erynyl\|Erynyl]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Syra\|Syra]] are allegedly from the abyss
JESS - weird that there's,,, drow already in the abyss hm ... j hanging, in the abyss.

We circle back to the mission

E suggests removing [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]] from the *political* board.
S suggests discrediting their Sight
	E agrees - hints to an additional secret, will reveal within the week
F suggests putting the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] MM or HP as a scapegoat
	S agrees - knows a [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]] traitor who could convince the House
	Fabia could take advantage of her shop clientele - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]]

However, Desor are not stupid.
	Sas feels discomforted by using [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Afern\|Afern]] as a scapegoat?

Garlick successfully stole Atton's trinket and disappeared.

S and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Martel\|Eos' Aliases#Martel]] head out first
Hear a commotion outside - heavy armoured footfalls
	Through the windows, see 12 city guards approach, led by a very haughty male drow ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Tathlyn\|Tathlyn]])
	He pushes a young kobold up against the wall
	An older male drow with dirty furs and a long staff steps out - the Old Guy Atton fought in 1.
	He shakes his head, and the kobold is released.

Martel leans by the window and looks out.
Other patrons, then F and A join.

S goes to the back, there's a chef in a narrow kitchen.
Chef - You're not supposed to be here
S - I'm trying to leave through the back door
S slips his grasp, darting for the door, and escapes into the back alley.

The guards are grabbing people and questioning them.
Taflin - Atton!
A - Taffy!
T - You're under arrest, your father [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kelor\|Kelor]] told me to arrest you for the murder of four city guards.

Atton teleports to their echo, then goes invisible.
	Causes necro dmg (-1HP) to Eos when he goes invis

All shroom guys here head into the back, behind a locked door.

Guards ask Martel - Have you seen a red kobold?
M/E - Not in a couple hours, didn't see where they went (telling the truth)
Guards release him.

Fabia also slips out through the back, still just carrying their drinks lmao

Sas heads to Renri.

M/E heads to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Aunelis\|Nilwelv#Aunelis]] - through Renri and Elvila, and isn't unnerved by the strangeness.
Drops the Alter Self as soon as they enter, and don't bother pulling up their mask.
Meets [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arnet\|Arnet]] at the base of the stone steps up to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Elggedir\|Nilwelv#Elggedir]].

Arnet - Eosphorus, where have you been?
E - I was in an alternative dimension for 5 hours, then got caught up with a group I couldn't shake. 
E - I wasn't at the Desor meeting, even if it was my body. What happened?
A - We met with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Artel\|Artel]], as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Saba\|Saba]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Afern\|Afern]] were apparently busy attending other matters. We detailed - they - he detailed the feud between [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]]. He asked for our assistance, offered large sums of money. You, or not-you didn't accept. We returned, then you left.

A - What do you mean, alternate dimension?
Eos speaks of the archway and the elven runes

A - Was this about [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]]? 
E - Yes
A - You are not to tell anyone. Follow me, we have much to discuss.
