#session 

Before we set off, we all hear some laboured breathing from the entrance of Aunelis.
There are people chasing Garlick - we kill them all.

Garlick gives us some old parchment scrolls, charred at the edges.
- Handwritten letters and notes, ~ 3440 PH
- [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ebeys\|Ebeys]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ayada\|Ayada]] - they had a mentor/mentee relationship.
- Ayada wanted knowledge from the dragons
	- She suspected [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Uss'lyn\|Uss'lyn]] wanted to overthrow her.

Garlick had gone home to the ruined homes of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]].
Found the notes in a false bottom of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lyra\|Lyra]]'s desk.

Eos loots the guards
	Finds 10SP and a wanted poster for Garlick (for 15GP)

The bodies are starting to reanimate, and ghoulish shadows start to advance.
Eos pats a body on the head, and we all head out.

Garlick has a ring that they hide *in*.

Everyone else disguises themself, and we head to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Adona's Curiosities\|Adona's Curiosities]]. 
In our head, we hear - Greetings, welcome to my store.

Shop has Potions of Drowning (renders targets unconscious in a very *disgusting* way), webbed gauntlets, and other knick-knacks.
We buy Communicators and a ball of wet seaweed.

Fabia holds the ball - I want to make a cloak for Garlick.
	A seaweed cloak forms from the ball, and the ball doesn't decrease in size.

**Library team**

We head to House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Lirast\|Lirast]], and into the building, towards the library.

Eos heads there as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Lla'aes\|Eos' Aliases#Lla'aes]].
Eos recognises the tall drow in the corridors - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Anora\|Anora]], and the lady behind the desk - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Davina\|Davina]].

Two robed figures slide two tablets with arcane symbols over to her.
One of the archways swirl with white light before revealing a corridor of books.

Eos writes a quick letter, then puts their mask on.
Davina looks uncaring and aloof.
D - Your signature is not enough. I need something from a member of the ruling council.
E - ... Who are you?
	I've struck a nerve, she looks pained/sad
Davina tries to throw us out.

Anora walks in, and Davina bites her tongue.
Anora gives us access - Anything for our friends in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]].

We enter the new portal.

Underground team

Sas and Garlick head to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Dark Keep\|Dark Keep]]. 

There should be no trouble. The clientele look rich, but many have fae-glow weapons and items (a pipe, gloves)

Sas meets [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ona\|Ona]].
S - The one i was protecting is dead. I think I fucked up.

S - I want information on the people under your domain. 
O - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kato\|Kato]] has successfully taken over the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Servants\|Servants]], and will be here soon to talk to the boss.
O - Kato meets [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Elant\|Elant]] [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Maytyl\|Maytyl]] at the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Silk House\|Silk House]] once a month with a big crate. We can only assume it's being taken to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Hollows\|Hollows]]. 

Sas slides 500GP to Ona.
S - Look out for the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]]. Have you heard anything about [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Aunerel\|Aunerel]]?
O - She's dead, or has not been seen.

Kato walks in, with glowing swords.
He has a human companion with a longsword of ice, and a short drow companion with a glowing dragon-bone pipe.

S slides the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] symbol across the bar to Kato.
Tries to stealth away - both S and G get a nat 1 
Human woman Slams Sas against the wall.
