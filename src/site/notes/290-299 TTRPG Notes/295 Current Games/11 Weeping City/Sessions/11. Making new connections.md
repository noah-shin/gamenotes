#session 

Fabia is in the kitchen

Finds three talking about 'killing the traitor [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vyrek\|Vyrek]])' in order to resurrect a dragon
- Human
- Purple dragonborn
- Green dragonborn

She ties them up, then tells [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Saba\|Saba]] about their plan
- Saba already knows about Auvryath

---

Eos seeks out [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arnet\|Arnet]]

He doesn't look great
Smells like blood and rot, worse than usual
A - Overdue treatment by [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ulvyr\|Ulvyr]]. He's been busy.

Atton's body was Not returned to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]], nor given to Arnet.
Ulvyr has been teaching [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ilvesz\|Ilvesz]] in the lab.

E - Do you know anything about the Ice Queen or the Weeping Maiden?
A - I recognise their names. The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Weeping Maiden\|Weeping Maiden]] is much less fair or benevolent, and takes more freely. The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]] has presided over the [[Above\|Above]] for as long as I can remember.

E minor illusions Martha
Arnet looks surprised, recognises here
A - I thought she'd be dead by now.
A - A topic I'm forbidden to discuss. But what was done to you was also done to others. Just none were visited or chosen as you were.
A - She poses a major threat to you, to the foundation Do'ghym has built. We will have to find and deal with here.
A - We cannot afford to have that selection process exposed. 

E - What about her partner, Benjamin?
A - She is going to be severely disappointed. For all intents and purposes, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Benjamin Drake\|Benjamin Drake]] is dead. 
A - Doctor Drake was a dangerous man. He is now dead enough that he cannot continue his work.
A - He was a menace to the city and not a part of Do'ghym.

Eos is ordered to bring [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Martha\|Martha]] in.
A - If I don't see her brought here within a week, I'll retrieve her myself.

Eos gets back to work for the week

Notices that [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Iymes\|Iymes]] has taken a meeting without me
This is very unusual.
Also realises that this isn't the first time
This breaks a barrier in my memory - this happens once every three years, nobody knows anything.

Hears light footsteps leaving the throne room
Sees a familiar white glowing being, who's surprised and vaguely amused I can see them.
Fae - I'm a long friend of Do'ghym's.
F - You're bound to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]]. My Queen will not be pleased with Do'ghym's treachery.
Eos bullshits their way through, refuses the claim of treachery. May be bound in one way, but not in all.
Also offers their services to the WM as well - claiming diplomatic ties, infiltration, and opportunity.
F is amused and considers taking me up on my offer.
F - They call me [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Fray\|Fray]].

---

E phones Garlick, then goes to visit.
G is very nervous, but talks about the dragon shard - its been visiting the fountain daily.

---

Garlick visits the fountain again.
Then visits [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Bet\|Bet]] - and sets up traps around her home, which she finds annoying but endearing.

In the small kobold community, the air feels tense.
There's a dark dried bloody pool - the aftermath of a House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] raid, that Garlick had narrowly escaped in the past.

Most of the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] folk are ready for a rebellion, to reinstate the House.
Garlick is becoming a bit of a figurehead, and gives a FANTASTIC speech.

Spends the week training up its little army

---

Garlick passes unnoticed to the fountain (due to the seaweed cloak)
Could almost swear they feel scales when they run its hand through the water
Feel a confused and wounded vibe.

Notices a lot of commotion around the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]] apothecary at the beginning of the week with Eos.
A body is taken out a day or so later.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Myrel\|Myrel]] visits and stays for a Long while.

---

One day, the fountain feels less confused.
Gives Garlick a purple scale
It hears a familiar distant booming voice - Your loyalty nor your sacrifice to Auvryath have gone unnoticed. 
Voice - Bring this scale to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vieren\|Vieren]]. They will need it to bring me back.

Gives the scale to Vieren, though it is a struggle.
V is also *visibly* present in the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Black Web Inn\|Black Web Inn]].

---

Martha is looking for leads on [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Benjamin Drake\|Benjamin Drake]].

Reading 'Sanguine Malificium' - the book they took from the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Lirast\|Lirast]] library.
Finds notes from the Matron and HP of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]].
Finds out that they're often out with the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Dead Carts\|Dead Carts]].

Finds the cart - with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Emos\|Emos]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eya\|Eya]]. 
Strolls up, then the Do'ghym guards hold her back with the end of a glaive.
M - I'm Dr Martha Shaw

Eya looks over, and there was a flicker of recognition in her eyes, but now looking straight ahead.
Martha tries a Charm Person thing on Emos.

M - As a good doctor, all my work is for free.

Emos gestures for the cart to stop, then gets down and looks at Martha a little closer.
Emos - What was your name again?

Emos gently takes her wrist, and a thin silver needle
Emos - A simple identification spell. I only need a drop of your blood.

Martha lets it happen.
Emos sucks Martha's finger clean 
(AN: uhuh)
Her eyes widen, grasp tightening, desperately

Emos - Are you really her? My mother will be thrilled to finally meet you, your works are inspired.
Emos - I can give you an audience with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ris'el\|Ris'el]] in 7 cycles, they will be expecting you.

Martha pulls her mask off, but there's no visible reaction
She allows the cart to pull away.

---

Martha spots the back of a tall skinny guy with brown hair - longer than she remembers.
She runs after him, follows him into his house.
He turns - Martha is convinced this is Benj.

Martha follows him home
Hugs him, but he doesn't hug back, confused and uncomfortable
A blue tiefling with a baby walks out a room - Who is this?
Martha - Benjamin? Don't you recognise me?
Guy - Are you okay?

Martha, mortified, just Leaves.

---

Sasrene grabs a new disguise kit from [[Blaggard\|Blaggard]]
Cannot see anyone following her there, so gets an all black wig and new mask.

Heads to meet Eos

On the way, hears a tiny voice from foot level - Hey you!
Sees a tiny man sat precariously on some frost-bitten red flowers than have sprung up from nowhere.
Fae - It's good to see you again! I was inside you fairly recently! Not like that, but, I got a taste.
- Was the one controlling Sas' body
F - I did what I was told, got you where we needed you to go
F - I want to get in that body again, just for half an hour
F - On behalf of our beloved [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]] (sarcastic), I was to help you meet your friends. Admittedly, I did get side-tracked. Your life is _fascinating_. There's just so much you don't know. 
F - I've got just a little more feeding to do.
F - I had a nice little gossip with the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/High Weaver\|High Weaver]]
F - I feed on tragedy and heartbreak. Love a good story of lost love. I spoke with this woman for 15 minutes and it was _almost_ enough. I promise I won't push as many buttons as last time.

Agree to do it. 
Code word to activate it is 'Wattpad'

F - If you're away from your body for a day and more, you would die.
F - Do you know what a solstice is? You can call me the [[Night of Winter Solstice\|Night of Winter Solstice]]
F - Us [[Knights of the Order\|Knights of the Order]], we're sort of like a hive mind, though I've never met them.
F - I'm not really supposed to be here.
F - I'm currently under the order of the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]], though tides are shifting.

He reaches into the back of his mouth and pulls out a molar.

F - I need one of yours. As a sign of our deal.

Then Sasrene can feel his tooth in the back of her mouth, cold, and he melts into the ground.

---

Heads to the Shelith tent, meets up with Eos
Eos as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Rinar'ust\|Eos' Aliases#Rinar'ust]].

Sas shares a bit about meeting the Night of Winter Solstice
They make a bit of a plan to circumvent any negative repercussions.

Eos shares the fact they've been told to bring Martha in.
Sas agrees that she won't stop them

S - There was someone in the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]] with an unusual relationship with the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/High Weaver\|High Weaver]] - the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Harvester\|Harvester]]. More depth to it. She was a Weaver, but during the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] usurping, both came back shaken and changed. She since left without a trace.
