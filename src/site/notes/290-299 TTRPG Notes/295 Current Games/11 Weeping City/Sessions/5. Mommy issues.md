#session 

Sasrene heads to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Silk House\|Silk House]].

There, it is mostly the same folk, though not Kato or the Mask.
On the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Smiling Mask\|Smiling Mask]]'s table, there's a piece of paper and a spray of blood.
	It's a letter written in blood - 'Be seeing you :)'

Spots a group with someone who looks like [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arven\|Arven]].
Overhears - There's always the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Dead Carts\|Dead Carts]]. You might want to get in with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]].
Sas attempts to follow them.
The group cross a bridge and the wind picks up. Arven has two normal arms, instead of the wood of before.

Heads to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Rug Shop\|Rug Shop]]
S - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Cutter\|Cutter]]?

The mushrooms recede, creating a path into the shop.

At the centre is a hooded figure, wreathed in thick blue smoke.
Cutter sighs - Knew you'd find me here kid
S - That guild was yours! They can't run you out!
C - They can. The shit they're running, they're going to take the underground from the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Collectors\|Collectors]].
	He's talking about stuff from the surface, and from the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild\|Feywild]]

He's got a festering frost-bitten wound, and looks tired, the mushrooms creeping back.
C - Find the contact, shut it down.

Heads to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Church of Lolth\|Church of Lolth]], the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Elen'y\|Elen'y]] is in the church session.
Her room is in the basement.

In their room, there's a part of a black cloth w/ a white symbol painted/spilled on.
Sas copies the symbol and takes the cloth, destroying the bag.

---

Fabia heads to Ekel to buy some armour.

Crit fails the investigation, ends up in a shady area.
Gets mugged, and now needs money to get to the next level.
Find a merchant heading up the stairs.
Takes out a pan flute, starts playing 'Toss a coin' - 25 Performance
The busking is successful, and she starts gathering money in the cloak
	There are eyes on her, and maybe not for the best reasons.

Passes through into [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Elvila\|Nilwelv#Elvila]].

Looks around to ask about a local blacksmith, ends up in-front of a group of six [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]] soldiers, with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Myrel\|Myrel]] in the centre.
	The group look at Fabia in disgust before walking away.

Goes to grab money from the bottom of the fountain
Fails a Wis save, something resisting her taking the money
Hears - Don't touch my hoard
15 psychic dmg

Heads to work - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Na T'puuli\|Na T'puuli]]

Boss - You're late
F - You would _not_ believe the day I've had
Jeremy tells him the vague beats of the day
Fabia takes their jewellery repair stuff to the back.

Eos finishes their conversation with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arnet\|Arnet]].

E - You heard anything about murders? Unusual targets or by a kobold and the eldest [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] son? 
A - There's an execution planned. [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atrys\|Atrys]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kelor\|Kelor]] are in talks, but Atrys wants him dead.

Eos heads North-East, towards House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]], but also to hopefully run into Atton.

---

Atton heads home, using his Echo to get past the tiers.

In the courtyard, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Abryn\|Abryn]] is sparring with the guard.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kelor\|Kelor]], their father, is watching from a distance. 
For a moment, it looks like he's seen Atton, but then he turns his gaze.

A makes a shadow self run in the opposite direction, and all the guards go after it, though one is dubious.

He heads up the stairs, before dropping invisibility, and starts stumbling down the corridor.
Pushes open the fancy double doors to Atrys' private trianing quarters Aragorn style.
	She trains her daughters only, so Atton's not been in here a lot.

Atrys is currently training [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Iyshr\|Iyshr]] ; pushes her to the floor and wipes the blood off her sword, without looking at Atton.
Iyshr leaves.

Atton - What did I do wrong?
He throws his glaive on the floor infront of her.
Atrys - Killing our men, with a kobold, then helping the kobold escape? You've never been more of an embarrassment.
Atton - I don't remember it, not for the usual reasons. I've never lied to you, and I don't intend to start.

He fails persuasion, and she hits him with the base of her sword.
He doesn't protect himself.
Knocks him prone, and kicks him.
He switches with his Echo, then pulls off his main piece of armour - revealing his arm brace, beneath which is black magic running through his arm, constantly altering, reacting to the room around him like shadows.

Atton - I'm not going to fight you, I never am. I'm simply giving you everything I am, and if you don't want anything to do with me, be done with me.
Atrys genuinely pauses to consider if he possesses any worth to her.

Atrys - I don't think I do need anything to do with you.
She throws her sword to skewer him to the mirrored wall, rendering him unconscious.
In his last moments, he sees a familiar figure enter the room.

Eos heads to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]]

As they pass [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]], they spot a familiar spiderling carriage, embellished with the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]] symbol.

Eos waits outside with it, sending a small spider into the building.
At the beginning of the corridor inside, sees Do'ghym guards.
The top of the stairs, sees [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ulvyr\|Ulvyr]].
