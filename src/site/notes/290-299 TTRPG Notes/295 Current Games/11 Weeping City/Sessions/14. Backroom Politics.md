#session 

Garlick is in the room with all the dragons.

In shock.
It throws up in the corner.
In a panic, they pull out a 20ft wooden ladder from its coat, hitting the ceiling.

Idryth - We have one more shock, you should sit down.
I - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Yza\|Yza]] also survived.
I - When [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]] was attacked, our lair was ambushed by the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]].
I - The Seers saw to it that the ambush would be when we're at our weakest. We killed the assassins, but were forced to retreat.
I - She was taken to House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]] for reasons we don't yet know.

I - Will you help us?
G - Tell me what I need to do.

---

Other kobolds were sent to find each of us.

---

Martha is at House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]], in her lab.

M charms the kobold.

M - Who sent you? 
Kobold - Idryth. She's a not-dead deep dragon, along with the three living members of Auvryath, Garlick, and some other people. We're going to do a heist!

M - What's your name?
Kobold - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Digby\|Digby]].
Digby - Everyone's at the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Black Web Inn\|Black Web Inn]], I can escort you there.

M - Do you plan on me getting harmed in any way whatsoever?
D - Not me, and I don't think anyone else is planning that either!

M - How did you get in here?
D - I was already here, getting my treatment.

They head to the Inn.

---

Fabia is in her room at [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]].

She hears a knock at the door, and opens it to see a grizzled kobold.

Kobold - You're Fabia?
F - I am. Who's asking?
Kobold - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Fucking\|Fucking]].
Fucking - Your friends need your help with a heist.
Fa - I thought you'd be more convincing?
Fu - I work for somebody very rich.
Fa - I need insurance.

Fucking unclasps an old chain with a rusty ring from around his neck.
Fu - This was my Grandma's. You can keep it till we get there.

Head to the Inn.

---

Sas was contacted by Garlick, but first is sneaking to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] building.

---

Eos is stalking around, looking for Arnet.

Their robe is tugged on by a young looking little yellow kobold.

Kobold (scared) - Eos?
Eos - ...
Kobold - Some of your friends asked me to find you. If you want. To go, that is.
E - ... Who are you?
Kobold - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Toad\|Toad]]. I'm an envoy for, for, for - I can't tell you.
E - ... If it's a secret, then they don't have any power, and I'm uninterested.
E - But what do you mean, my _friends_?
Toad - I've been sent on behalf of ... I've been told that you're a little less than trustworthy, so I shouldn't share secret information like this with you. But, they're not in power now. And, they will be by the end of the day. If that helps.
T - I would hate to see you die.
T - From being on the wrong side of the power shift, not as a threat!
T - But uh, your friends, Garlick, and the others?
E - Ah. So plans are being set into motion today.
E - Inconvenient, but lead the way.

Head to the Inn.

---

Along the way, Eos calls everyone.

Hits up Garlick, to confirm that they're not being led into a trap.
Confirms Fabia is also coming.

Phones Martha, who subtly gloats that they know more than Eos about what's happening here.
Eos tries to fake out that they know more than they do.
Finds out we're heading to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Black Web Inn\|Black Web Inn]].
Finishes the call, and mutters under their breath - I cannot kill them. Cannot kill them.

Then Sas, who hasn't got a kobold.
S - It's a good day for final showdowns.

Eos twigs where S is going.
They chat, but Eos actually kinda sees the point of Sas going to kill [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atrys\|Atrys]].

E - Go get your revenge. I'm for you, but I think it'd be nice if you could wait, just a bit.
E - I'll see you later, or I'll see your familiar with your will.

---

Sas phones Garlick

G - Are you not with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Fredrick\|Fredrick]]?
S - I don't know. I've been very sneaky this morning.
S - Do you need me?
G - We have a plan, but your plan is to do some murder?
S - I'm going to go kill [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atrys\|Atrys]]. She usurped my mother and tried to kill me.
G - It's your day, do what you want. It'd just be nice to have you here.
S - She deserves to get thrown in a body pit.
G - Maybe a hug would work? But if not, you know where I am.

---

Sas calls Eos back

S - I need to at least see her.
S - And the will is actually in my tent.
E - Kill her for me.
S - Keep them safe. You're the only one I trust with that.

---

Arnet doesn't respond to Eos' comm.

Eos keeps the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Shadow Men\|Shadow Men]] around her, and they might respond if I ask them to do something.

Casts Identify on their new amulet, to confirm it works.

Eos as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Platin'ust\|Eos' Aliases#Platin'ust]] when I get half an hour out from the Inn.

---

The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Black Web Inn\|Black Web Inn]] is strangely empty, considering the hour and how close it is to the entrance of the city.

Martha turns up.

There's someone in a circle booth that Martha doesn't recognise - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vieren\|Vieren]].

Martha says hi as Fabia and Eos turn up.
Fabia doesn't recognise Vieren either, though Eos faintly recognises him.

Vieren - If you're ready, I feel like I shouldn't tell you anymore until I can show you.
Eos - Well, half of us already know what's going on.
V - Ah. Well. If you'd like to follow me to the back?

---

Head to the backroom.

The beefy no-name steps out with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lyra\|Lyra]].
Eos recognises her, and shallowly bows. She ignores him.

We can see into the room.
Eos knows [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vyrek\|Vyrek]], and faintly recognises [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Idryth\|Idryth]]. 
Fabia recognises Vyrek, though the pair wouldn't have spoken.

Eos enters, sitting on the bed, and pats Vyrek on the knee.
Fabia and Martha also step in, the room becoming rather cramped.
Vieren enters, and closes the door behind him.

Eos (respectfully) - It's good to see you all again. It's been a while.
Vieren clears his throat, then motions to Idryth.

I - It's good to see you all as well. There's no delicate way to put this, so. I am Idryth, of what is left of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]]. 
I - You have all been called upon to help us with a heist. We plan to take the fountain in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Elvila\|Nilwelv#Elvila]] market to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Aunelis\|Nilwelv#Aunelis]], and resurrect the dead dragon that is trapped in the crystal within.
I - The city guards are preoccupied with closing the city gates, in the lower tier of the city. So we will be in the unguarded middle tier.
I - We need you and our assorted muscle to take out any guards that might still be there.
I - Once we're at the fountain, we will leave it to [[Todd\|Todd]] to grab the crystal and move it safely.

At the base of the bed, she opens a chest and pulls out a small golden bird cage, with an iridescent light-blue toad inside.
The toad blinks slowly.

I - This is [[Todd\|Todd]]. 
I - He found us when we were travelling in a sea hag lair. We're not entirely sure what he is, but we think of him as a living Bag of Holding.
I - So when we go to the crystal, your party will take out the guards, if any. Todd will eat the shard, then regurgitate it in Aunelis. Vyrek will then resurrect the dragon [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erzel\|Erzel]].

I - During our exile, we got sucked into the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild\|Feywild]], then a sea hag lair. Todd came to our rescue, as we all jumped inside him, and he jumped to safety.
I - We think he's a portal, a normal frog combined with some fae mystery magic.
I - As far as I'm aware, there will be no deaths required for this. The only physical component is the dragon scale, which you have already brought to us Garlick.

Martha - Why are we supposed to help you?
I - We need muscle
G - I thought we were friends??

M - I'm just worried about a dragon coming to life and killing us all.
I (telling a partial truth) - Erzel is a great guy.
	Eos clocks that there have definitely been times where Erzel, the best of all the deep dragons, was not so great.

E - What do you know of Aunelis?
I - I know it's empty, and so the only feasible place in the city to perform the ritual.
E - But do you know *why* it's so empty?
I - Ghost stories
E - Ghost stories often have real things behind them. Just as a word of warning.
I - We're planning on hitting the clearing close to the cavern wall, deeper in Aunelis. Will that be a problem?
E - There is so much latent and active necromantic magic there, that, potentially yes. 
E - What if there was a distraction at House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]]? Could we perform it at the Auvryath ruins, or in the market itself?

---

Sas arrives, she had sent her familiar with a note to her sister instead.

She calls Eos, before feeling a presence behind her.
A skinny dagger is pressed up against her throat, and she recognises it as Auvryath make.

S - Please remove the knife from my throat. I'm here to help.

Eos hears this, and heads out into the main room. 
Sees [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lyra\|Lyra]] behind Sas.

Lyra circles around Sas, keeping the knife at her throat.

S - You look grown up.
L - Thanks to you.
S - Yeah. The chance you have is due to (my) mercy.
L - Wow. Interesting choice of words. 
L - You're here to help us? I find that very hard to believe.
S - I made a promise to Vieren and to Garlick, and I'm going to keep it.
L - You make one, *one* wrong move, and I will, I promise, I *will* kill you.

Lyra pulls away, trying to nick Sas, who dodges just in time.

E - Anyone for a drink?

In the silence, they shuffle Sas to the backdoor, and does the single 'secret knock'
E - I'm glad you didn't die.
S - I wrote a note, think you'd be proud of it.

Eos ushers Sas in, before going to talk to Lyra.

---

Sas recognises Idryth as the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Harvester\|Harvester]]. 

S - Cool skin you're wearing. Who's underneath it?
I - And you are?
S - Well, I knew the original wearer of her skin.
I - Yes, the people who tried to kill me. Are you with them?
S - I was, and still am. But you might know me better from the letters, as 'the girl'?
I (insincere) - Sorry, I don't make a habit of remembering the names of people so insignificant.
S - ... I'm Sasrene Angalene Vriiryn xund Estra of House Lar'Lolth nee House Shavlyl. 
I - It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Idryth, though you might already know that from all your snooping into my personal business.

I - I assume you're here to help, though I do wonder why.
S - I get it, but you might want to get into contact with your other dragon in the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]]. The last I saw her, she was in House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]], so you might need to contact her.

I - You're very ...
S - I'm very angry right now.
I - Hm. Amusing.

G - Am I the only one who didn't know all this? 
I (truthful) - This is news to me.
I - Or rather, that she's within La'val. I was trying to keep her position within the city a secret, as she was my failsafe. Not anymore ...
S - She wasn't a secret anyway.
G - Why have none of you told me this before??

---

Eos to Lyra - You were in the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild\|Feywild]], right? Shit's gone tits up here regarding the [[Prophecy\|Prophecy]].
L - I've heard that there's a shifting of power amongst the Archfey. 
L - In the sea hag lair, we came across a half-dead individual who was rambling about some kind of pact they'd made with the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]]. Something like 'It all went wrong, they shouldn't have, they'd been left there to die', etc.
L - They didn't seem capable of seeing or hearing us, only looking into the distance.
L - They were pretty humanoid, some kind of surface elf, maybe a half elf?

---

Head back to the backroom

L - We were just going to let the dragons do the 'talking' for us, then take the whole city back.
L - We plan to destroy the current ruling council, kill anyone loyal to them, then re-establish order as it was.

Eos - Have you ever been the only House here?
I - It depends who you ask. We dragons have been above the city, with the city as an extension of our domain, since before Do'ghym setting in what was Orthel.

E - Be wary of the additional forces. Do'ghym have vested interests here, the Underground ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Collectors\|Collectors]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Servants\|Servants]]) are moving, the city guard are preoccupied with a cult, and the Archfey ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Weeping Maiden\|Weeping Maiden]]) are in every corner of the city.
I - I am not concerned with the Archfey in the slightest, they can do as they please.

We start arguing about the morality of killing everyone in the city.
Idryth casts Frightening Presence, and everyone except Eos gets too scared to speak.

Eos - It's not that we want to stop you. But you have far more potential allies in this room than you may think.

Garlick casts Detect Magic - the room is Flooded in divination magic, except for a dead spot around Eos.
	Someone is or was watching us.

Garlick goes into a panic, and casts Flock of Familiars.
100 parrots appear in the room, perching everywhere in the already cramped space.

---

The front door of the tavern is Slammed open.

Sas, Martha, Vieren, and Eos' spider head out.
They spot two [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] guards holding the doors open.
Through them, they can barely make out three black carriages bearing the sigils for [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]], [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]], and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]].

Outside the Shavlyl carriage is [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atrys\|Atrys]], accompanied by two guards, looking very bored.
Outside the Desor carriage is [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Saba\|Saba]], with a flock of handmaids and a shadow crawling at her feet.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]] floats out the La'val carriage, with four handmaids and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eltyr\|Eltyr]]. She smiles softly at the party.

Atrys' eyes linger on Sasrene, though she cannot tell if she recognised her.
