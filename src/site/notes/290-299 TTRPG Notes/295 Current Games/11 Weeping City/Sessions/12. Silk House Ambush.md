#session 

Sasrene and Eos

Someone opens the tent door above
Sas' familiar goes upstairs, invisible.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ylda\|Ylda]] is upstairs

Sas sneaks up, closes the trapdoor, then coughs.
L - Your friend, Fabia ... something is happening at the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Silk House\|Silk House]]. 
Lelder goes to leave.
L - I've already said too much.

Sas hits up everyone, though Martha doesn't respond.

Eos casts Detect Magic - we're shrouded in divination magic.

Fabia heads to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Silk House\|Silk House]] for the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Collectors\|Collectors]] meeting.

There are plenty of people around, with lots of glowing items and weapons.
Lots of people with white eye masks.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kato\|Kato]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ullus\|Ullus]] are both there. Ullus has bloody hair, tiny glasses, and looks defeated.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ona\|Ona]] is sat in a wheelchair, heavily bandaged, staring into nothing.

K - Collectors! You have been called to witness.
U - The Collectors would like to formally welcome the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Servants\|Servants]] as a Thieves Guild, and as our partners, with immediate effect.

The Collectors here start murmuring.

K - From now on, we will be working as equals, as one guild.
He pulls out a gold coin and starts doing tricks with it as the Collectors grow more outraged.

U - Please. His word is final.
K - Anyone who wants out, the door is open.

Two people leave, both decapitated as they reach the door.

K - Anyone else? No? 
K - I'm so glad we get to work together. You will all be hearing from me very soon.
He steps away from the front, and people start whispering.

Fabia sees a tall masked man, ponytail of white hair, black sclera eyes, staring at her.
There's unbridled hatred and something targeted in his stare (AN : Demon Daddy) 

F secretly comms the group - I've received amazing news. Do you want to get a drink?
S - We'll make a party of it, cause we're already on our way.
G - How do you feel about fire?
F - The place is pretty cold right now.

Two people walk up and grab Fabia from either side.
She managed to yank away from one, but not the other.
Taken over to the mysterious man.
Guy - You're coming with me.
	Fabia recognises the voice as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atton\|Atton]].

Taken outside.

F - I have two questions.
A - I don't have time for that, I'm busy.

The group arrive.
Eos sees the four (Atton, Fabia, two bodyguards) and recognises them all.
Also spots the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Smiling Mask\|Smiling Mask]] on a rooftop (bone-white masked figure)

E to Arnet - Containment breach at the Silk House.

Atton draws a sword, the blade is invisible in darkness. He strikes out at Fabia.
Sas, not knowing who he is, immediately attacks him.
Garlick turns up with four other kobolds to help out.

Atton summons his Echo next to Sas - causing her to recognise him.
Sas down to 5HP.

She walks towards him, pulling out his arm-brace.
	She got it from Martha's house where Atton (or just his armour) was.

S - I've been meaning to give this back to you.
Atton feels like he was stabbed in the chest, begins to remember his death, his own name.
S - I'm sorry I couldn't protect you from her.

Sas notices that Atton is wearing a black word with a stone choker, etched with an unknown rune - ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Lore/Runic Magic\|Runic Magic]]).
Eos identifies the rune as meaning CHANGE.

Eos' shadows have been summoned and are beginning to emerge.

Sas cuts the collar off, releasing a wave of necromantic energy.
A picks up the collar, tries to go invisible.
Eos counterspells.
Atton hits E for 30HP
Sas hits Atton, and he goes down.

Fabia casts Detect Magic - there's necromantic energy everywhere, and Eos is surrounded with divination.

Sas - What do I need to do?
Eos casts Enthral, murmuring words of comfort to her.
The shadows silently take Atton's body.
