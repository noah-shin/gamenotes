#session 

We open in the Underdark, 3 miles below the World Above – under the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Oron Aia\|Oron Aia]], an ice-capped mountain range where the veil separating the Material Plane and the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Feywild\|Feywild]] is strangely thin.

Through the dark caves and winding tunnels beneath – to a large, walled cavern – [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv\|Nilwelv]]. 

A large, drow city under strict, Lolthite regime, known for its two great waterfalls and bright blue mushroom fields growing on the cavern ceiling. It is a city staggered into three, walled districts – the most wealthy live in Amrinti, high above Nyndinla, and higher still above Arl’She. 

We open in a Nilwelv unlike the Nilwelv you know – the city is on the precipice of war. In recent years, the harmony observed between the Feywild and Nilwelv/the Feywild and the Oron Aia has been disturbed. 

Tensions are rising between the drow and the surface elves as to who is to blame.

---

We open in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Ardulae\|Nilwelv#Ardulae]] - the council chambers.
Purple light fills the rooms from gems built into the walls, the banners of House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] on the stone pillars surrounding the room. They circle a set of stairs, which lead up to a table and five thrones, upon which sit five maidens, and standing behind, their eldest daughters.

The meeting is reaching its close - but there is one final item on the agenda.
The surface elves, preparing for war outside [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Greyrock\|Greyrock]].

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]] - The Great War is approaching. We should prepare.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Myrel\|Myrel]] - The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]] has been assassinating merchants for weeks.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eosphorus\|Eosphorus]] - Do you not know what your hand is doing?
M - You are suggesting a cull on the city's merchants. We will fall into ruin.
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Saba\|Saba]] - YOU will fall into ruin.

We take a vote.
5 women from shadows, giving a token of black stone and of white stone to each Matron.
Adjudicator – A hooded figure, entirely obscured, silently enters the room; in the bone white hands reaching out from their black robes – a box, made of shimmering, petrified silk webs.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Iymes\|Iymes]] gives their stone to Eos to vote - breaking the unspoken rules.
Eos votes white (yes).
Result : 3 white stones, 2 black.

The meeting ends, everyone walking away.
Iymes stares at where Saba was sat - Go to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]]. It's time to broker revenge.

In the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#L’vet (‘The Veil‘)\|Nilwelv#L’vet (‘The Veil‘)]] market areas.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arven\|Arven]] is closing down shop, unaware that [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Sasrene\|Sasrene]] is watching and waiting. 
Ordered by the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]], Sas has a 30GP reward for Arven's death. She also has a 1500GP reward from the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Collectors\|Collectors]] for a necklace - platinum, with a teardrop locket full of water (?).

Sas is aided by a 'Vibe' – voice poking out from her hair – little friend?
Within an instant, Arven is unconscious on the ground, and Sasrene slits her throat.
- the initial hit sounded hollow, not fleshy.
- Arven's arm is wooden (not prosthetic, but growing up her arm – like a petrifying disease?)

---

In the Theatre District - the Crescent, outside the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Ivory Theatre\|Ivory Theatre]].

Sasrene meets a Hooded Figure ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Fabia\|Fabia]]).
Weird interaction lmao, but exchange items.
Sas heads back to the DMH guild.

Fabia heads to the [[Bone Building\|Bone Building]].
Meets [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Wisp\|Wisp]], and gives her the necklace.

W - You should go, dear. You know he doesn't like you.
Hear a soft familiar twinkling as she breathes out the smoke from her fancy long pipe.
The smoke condenses into a small watery figure.

Figure - Do you have which I have asked?
Wisp gives it over
Figure - You are free, Wisp Sylvalane
And he disappears.
She throws down and breaks the pipe.

---

Still in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Ekel\|Nilwelv#Ekel]] - at the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Handsome Duregar\|Handsome Duregar]]
Barkeep is an old lady named [[Irina\|Irina]] (Atton calls her ReeRee)

There's a large fighting ring in the centre of the pub - deep dwarf vs half orc. 
Dwarf wins!
[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atton\|Atton]] is in the audience cheering and running bets.

Old man approaches, wearing a little [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] pin on his old cloak.
Man - You drag the Shalvyl name through the dirt, you coward!
Atton tries to buy a round for everyone, but the old guy knocks it over
Man - Your father would be ashamed. Does he know you're out here?
A - Wtf dude?
Old guy attempts a punch, but Atton summons an echo and intimidates him.
A - I'll let you leave.

Old man finally leaves, but gets hit by the doors opening as 4 soldiers enter - city guards, wearing Shavlyl colours.
Atton leaves with them, leaving his winnings as a tip.

---

Outside the pub is [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Garlick\|Garlick]], scrabbling in the bins for a silver spoon.
It's been told to come back by their friend [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Bet\|Bet]].

Atton is pushed out the inn by the soldiers, landing infront of Garlick.
Garlick 'cleans' atton with a hanky, before he's held in place by the soldiers, starts panicking at the touch 'reskinned rage'.

Everyone in the party feels a sudden chill, a cold wind whips past but everyone else seems unaware.
Everyone hears a voice - Come, this way.
And a stone archway materialises on a close wall.

---

Eos looks at the runes and glyphs etched into the archway - related to elvish? - then steps through.

Sas steps through, and their friend whispers - Fate is bullshit.

Wisp doesn't hear Fabia, like time is going on without us. Fabia ties to throw a tomato, but it leaves their hand before returning.

Atton walks through, disappearing from Garlick's sight.

---

Everyone steps into the dark, wind growing sharper, and the archway fades away behind us.

The wind turns to white like silk or snow, and the shifting figure of a man appears.
WIS save - so alien it's frightening (Atton, Garlick, Sas fail)

Cacophony of joyous voices - Delight! For YOU have been CHOSEN by [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]], the Queen of the Ice Mountains, for salient duty, in her service. Should YOU accept, YOU WILL BE SPUN with a WISH. That which YOU WISH most.

We each see [separate and personal] visions of our wish

Cacophony - Your duty to the Ice Queen – You must remove [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]] [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]] from the board.

Eos - Who are you?
Answer, many names are said at once, but the key one is - [[150-200 Notes/151 Archive/2022 Notes/11 Weeping City/11.02 Wiki/005. People/NPCs/Lord of Winter Winds\|Lord of Winter Winds]]
Eos - An mine is [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eosphorus\|Eosphorus]]

Eos - In what form will we receive the wish?
LWW - In the form of your vision, it is one of the future
Eos - Are they still alive?
LWW - Yes

Sas - What if my wish changes?
LWW - You will receive what you wish the most when you finish the contract
S - I do it alone?
LWW - Others have been chosen. I will tell you where to find them.
S - If I refuse?
The wind around her neck tightens, though it seems to all be fun and games to him.

Fabia - You have no other way to ask me, really?
LWW - I have been sent by the Ice Queen. This is the way she expects you to accept.
F - What stops me from betraying her?
LWW smiles - Betrayal will not be tolerated.
The wind cuts her for dmg

Atton - How do I know this is real?
The wind slows, and parts into a portal. Atton blinded by what he sees, afterimage of a smiling, blue-tinged face, and eyes of ice, like biblical angel ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]])

Garlick just slaps the hand in agreement after hearing [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Faeryl\|Faeryl]]'s name

Everyone eventually take the hands, palms burning with cold.
LWW - There are more chosen. Meet them at the Silk House.
