Eos and Martha head there, M won't take off her mask.
E sits by the fountain. M tries to walk up the side of the shop, but slides underneath it.

M finds herself in a square room of dirt and shrooms.
Every five feet are 'sticks' jutting from the dirt, with a blue bag attached.
	Partially decomposed human hands
	Glowing blue shrooms are growing from them
	The bags are general nutrients, blue for fun
	Bodies 'seem' to be dead, but with a faint pulse

Martha walks up the wall, out a hole in the ceiling.
Spots tables with strips of raw sunshine above the plants.
The other side of the room has a figure sleeping on a desk - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ren\|Ren]]

Eos brushes at the coins in the fountain
Feels a heavy sticky presence, takes some psychic dmg

Garlick and Sas turn up.

G shows E some of their shiny things
E starts reading the book from the library
	An anthology of Underdark fairytales
	About the fae in the Underdark and remnants of high magic
	Multiple stories of fae wearing people's skins, while humans are in the Plane of Delight

Martha helps Sas inside
Spots the glass leaf - takes it.
Spots correspondence to other cities on the desk
Spots a slightly open chest of gold
Takes the tray of fairy bonnets in the main room.

The bogwater is in a locked cabinet.

Martha takes off her mask and goes for a bite
- Mask wasn't magical - the darkvision must be natural
Kills Ren
Takes his keys and gets us all in.

Garlick uses their magical key to open the cabinet door
Turns the cabinet into another dimension where it's just raining gold
Grabs 40GP
Opens the cabinet again, grabs the bogwater.

Sas' familiar distracts the guards, so we all sneak out, and get home.
