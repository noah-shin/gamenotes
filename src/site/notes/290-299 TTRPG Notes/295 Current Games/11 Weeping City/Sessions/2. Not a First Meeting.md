#session 

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Sasrene\|Sasrene]] reappears in [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Ekel\|Nilwelv#Ekel]].
Roughly 5 hours have passed in the real world.
Her coin pouch has an extra 30GP in it.

Check in with her lil friend; went with Sasrene throughout.

Hears beautiful eerie piano music from somewhere nearbye.
Wants to go home to change, but feels a cold breeze at her ankles.
She keeps trying, -1HP as her hand burns.
The breeze knocks over a trash can with a dress, but she convinces her way back home.
Doesn't wake anyone up as she changes, before heading back to the pub.

Sees a figure walking jerkily towards her - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Fabia\|Fabia]].
She hides, next to a narrow dark building, pretending to be drunk.

---

F snaps back into their body.
In their pocket is a ticket to **Full of Borveath** at the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Ivory Theatre\|Ivory Theatre]].
- It's a play about the fall of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Auvryath\|Auvryath]]. [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Wisp\|Wisp]] is playing the Matron ([[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ebeys\|Ebeys]]).
They also have a small friend hiding under their clock.

F enters the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Silk House\|Silk House]]. 
Sees a soft swirling white glow around their hand.

---

Sasrene follows her in.

Sees other familiar faces in the patrons.
There's an eerie figure with a [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Smiling Mask\|Smiling Mask]], potentially [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arven\|Arven]], and other local thieves.
- a human woman
- a drow with red eyes and crackling red scars
- [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kato\|Kato]]
- 2 drow with clean skin beneath their robes, and deliberately dirtied hands.

She buys drinks for some of the thieves.

---

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Atton\|Atton]] comes back to, slightly sore and bloody, their glaive also covered in blood.

Heads towards the tavern.
Sees Fabia (doesn't recognise her, but sees the glow).
Recognises Sasrene, but decided to live in denial and heads straight to the bar.

At the bar, there's:
- an elf with white hair, drinking alone
- 3 barmaids, only the dwarf still awake
- a tanned heavily tattooed woman
- the bartender - [[150-200 Notes/151 Archive/2022 Notes/11 Weeping City/11.02 Wiki/005. People/NPCs/Grit\|Grit]] - a half-orc man, pale hair, blind in one eye

---

Eos wakes, and knows their vague whereabouts, but is unfamiliar with the lower city.
Finds a red hanky with embroidery of the House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] sigil and a cursive 'AD' - in their balled up fist.
- Knows it refers to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Artel\|Artel]] [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] - the elderboy

Talks to the air - I don't appreciate being taken for a ride like that.

Roughs up their spare clothes, then casts Alter Self to look like a local - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Martel\|Eos' Aliases#Martel]].

---

Sasrene thinks 'shit', and tries to grab Atton.

We all congregate at the bar.
- Eos gets a stale ale
- HF walks away
- Atton gets a white drink (label has crossed out 'Saltwater' and 'Fish Oil')
- Sas gets upcharged and threatened

The cook comes out - a hulking orc man with yellow eyes and a small cook's apron.

---

Sas leaves the bar, overhears one of the clean drow say '[[150-200 Notes/151 Archive/2022 Notes/11 Weeping City/11.02 Wiki/005. People/Unknown/Ezara\|Ezara]]'.
Is aware that the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Smiling Mask\|Smiling Mask]] has clocked her - and turns to look at her in the 'eyes'.

Eos stumbled into the table of the clean drow, but doesn't recognise them.

---

Fabia steals the bottle
to Atton - I will offer two rounds for a short truthful convo
F - How'd you get the hand mark?
A - I was drunk and there was a very spooky magic man
F - Was it cold?
A - Very
F - We were both figure visited by a servant of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ice Queen\|Ice Queen]] ... 
A - I'm still trying to figure out if that actually happened

They both also head outside.
Atton begins to argue with Sasrene.

A lil creature scurried out from under Fabia's cloak as they argue.
F reveals their name, Eos continues to pretend they're actually Martel.

The two clean drow come out, hands folded infront of them.
They bristle at the scene, then hurry off.

---

We head to Shelith, going over the bridge to Renri.
Some of the shadows start to move, and 8 people appear.
At the front is [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kato\|Kato]].
