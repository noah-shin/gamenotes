#session 

Eos dismisses the spider as Atton's body is dragged through the courtyard.
It draws eyes, but [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kelor\|Kelor]] isn't that sad or surprised, though [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Abryn\|Abryn]] looks kinda sad.

Eos steps forward for a terse greeting, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ulvyr\|Ulvyr]] looking at Eos with disdain, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Kelor\|Kelor]] with unease.
Ulvyr heads to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Elggedir\|Nilwelv#Elggedir]], back to the House.

---

Heads to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]].

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Erynyl\|Erynyl]] is standing by the spider stables, but they ignore each other.

At the entrance, a big golden door, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Artel\|Artel]] waits inside, looking slightly annoyed.

Eos returns the handkerchief, and asks to continue negotiations.
Diverts the question of whether this is an official visit.
Realises he's also slightly scared of Eos.

Artel - Do you ... eat food?
E - No.

He summons magical servants to begin serving him.

E - Why I reject you?
A - Why do we still have [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]] in the council? No-one likes them, they're a bit of a recluse. We're better than them, and definitely [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]]. We're not the only ones who want them gone. If you don't want our offering, talk to any other member of the Council.

E - Why couldn't [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Saba\|Saba]] be here?
A (lying) - Busy attending other matters, she doesn't think your house is that important.
E - Very well, the next visit will be official and with your mother attending
A isn't worried about my implied threat, more concerned that she may not be available.

Heads to Ekel.

Sasrene rests

Then heads to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/High Weaver\|High Weaver]]'s office - into the spartan and plain waiting room, with a couple of spiderlings.
A spine dart is thrown at Sas by an apologetic young drow.

She recognises two - [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Minelv\|Minelv]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ylda\|Ylda]]

M - You seen the HW? She seemed upset when you left last night.
S - None of your business. Do you want to be scrubbing the toilets? Do you remember anything?
M - Besides the crazy guys in masks you told us to watch out for?
S - Give me a written report of our conversation yesterday. Just so I know you can follow orders

Heads into the office, which is full of orderly chaos
	There are fresh purple scales with blood, scratchy notes next to it

While waiting, gets the report from the spiderlings.

Waits until the end of the day, when the High Weaver turns up
HW - Get out.
S - I need to explain. I wasn't myself, it doesn't make sense but -
HW - Get out of my office.
S - Can you at least tell me what happened?
HW pauses at the wording, but - I don't have time for this. We can talk about this later.

The HW feels slightly more unhinged / erratic than usual, scratching/hitting at her neck.
Something forcibly ejects Sas from the room.

S to the waiting room - Everyone get out.
Most people don't move, as its now more of the heavy hitters of the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]].

Sas heads back into the office, as the door isn't closed.

S - This is a conversation that needs to happen.
HW - What gives you the right to talk to me like that? You understand what you said to me.
S - Yes, but you choose family and I chose you. I'm not going to let what happened when I was in another dimension to get between us. I've done everything you asked me and I don't understand.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Elen'y\|Elen'y]] places a hand on her shoulder.
Sas takes out their spine darts, and gives them over.

S - Give these back if you decide you want me here.
Sas heads out, closing the office door.

---

Heads out into the streets, notices an increased city guard presence.

Cornered by guards in an alley.
Tosses a chromatic orb. Kills one, threatens the other, but he just dies anyway.
Mourning - lost family in three senses - Cutter, HW, and Atton.

---

Fabia is working, untangling jewellery.

Eos arrives, Fabia pops out from under the counter.

They go for a walk, agreeing on a secret code
	Desor = Dragonfruit, Apply = Arcice

Arrive at [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Elvila Blacksmith\|Elvila Blacksmith]], and F asks Eos in.
E - ???
Jeremy - They don't have great social skills, do they?

Here begins The Worst Shopping Trip â€“ two people in full masks who have never bought armour

F - I could play a song, or could kill the guy who your girl was spotted with
The owner fully buys into Fabia's lie, that his partner is cheating on him. He's absolutely *crushed*.
Owner - A song will do fine.

Eos leaves the shop in mortification.
Fabia plays the song for him, leaves with studded armour and bracers for free.

---

We head to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Aunelis\|Nilwelv#Aunelis]], and meet a weeping Sasrene.

E - Ah. So you know.

Sasrene attacks, dealing 10 dmg.
The air grows thicker, shadows where there's not supposed to behind.

A faint sound behind a wall.
Sas heads around it, finds [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Martha\|Martha]].
	She's a doctor, with a strange mask for her profession.
	Takes it off, revealing that she's human.

She's only been underground for the past few months, looking for something? That they couldn't get on the surface?

S - Why are you here?
M - I just want to help people
Eos can tell it's bullshit.

Actually heals Eos.

---

We agree to split up, research team and other.

Eos & Martha & Fabia to the Library 
	To figure out more on drow and potential murder methods

Sas & Garlick to ?
	To figure out the state of the underground and what's up
