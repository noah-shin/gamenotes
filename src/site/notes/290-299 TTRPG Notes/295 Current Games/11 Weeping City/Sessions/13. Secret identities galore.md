#session 

Martha finally arrives on the scene, accompanied by four big dudes wearing almost cartoonishly generic clothing.

Eos hands the necklace with the rune to Sas, silently apologetic.

Sas turns 180 and walks straight past Martha, sassing everyone.
Notices the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]] sigil pinned to the guys' clothing.

S to Martha - What's your motive? Why are you even here?

S whispers to G - Keep an eye on the shadows, their spines (AN: the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Organisation/Dark Mother's Hand\|Dark Mother's Hand]]'s weapon - the spider's dart) are coming your way.
G - Is this a threat?
S - No, it's a warning. You're not on my hit list, but you're on someone else's.

E to S - Stay safe.
E - And I owe you a favour.
S palms E a note :
	(SECRET) [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/La'val\|La'val]] are the ones watching you. Garlick is on their hit list.

Sas leaves towards [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Shelith\|Nilwelv#Shelith]].

---

E to M - New friends?
M - They seem helpful. I heard horrible things, so wanted to bring them along to help.
She seems to be telling the truth, with a little something on the side.
The men are acting of their own volition.

E - Why did they agree to help you?
M - Do people not do things out of good will?
E - No.
M avoids the answer.

Garlick doesn't start around dead bodies, but he ends around them. (Killer line by Vinnie)

---

Garlick heads home to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Shelith\|Nilwelv#Shelith]].

---

E and M head to her body pit.
Eos as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Martel\|Eos' Aliases#Martel]].

Hear commotion as we get closer to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Ekel\|Nilwelv#Ekel]]. 
It looks like most of the lower city have gathered, a large angry crowd. 
The city guards are trying to corral people.

People - A cult in the city? 
People - They're closing the gates!

Head to the second tier, where there aren't any guards any more.

---

Into the body pit.

Eos casts Detect Magic
	Profound lack of magic, almost a dead zone
	A slim red band ring on Martha's finger with abjuration magic

Martha reveals she knows about [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eos' Aliases#Llar'gent\|Eos' Aliases#Llar'gent]].
	Found out from [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Emos\|Emos]] of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]] - may have found out because [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Eya\|Eya]] sleeptalks.
	Is now close with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Ris'el\|Ris'el]] - the ring may have come from her.

Eos tells her that he talked with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arnet\|Arnet]] about her.
	That he's been told to bring her in, and that he only has a week to do so.
	About [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Benjamin Drake\|Benjamin Drake]] and how he's basically dead.

M doesn't know anything about [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lady Lara'el\|Lady Lara'el]].

Next day

---

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Snoss\|Snoss]], a purple kobold who is part of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vieren\|Vieren]]'s crew, power walks to Garlick.

Snoss - Now is the time to fight.
Garlick calls Sas - How would you feel about resurrecting a dragon today?
Snoss - The plan is for a small team to collect the 20ft water fountain, then to take the dragon shard to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Nilwelv#Aunelis\|Nilwelv#Aunelis]] and resurrect a dragon.

Garlick and the ten beefcakes head to the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Location/Black Web Inn\|Black Web Inn]].

Snoss - They're closing the city, apparently there's some kind of cult. It'll probably be a witch hunt.

Garlick finds out that [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vieren\|Vieren]] kidnapped [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vyrek\|Vyrek]], as Vyrek is the only one who knows how to cast this ritual.

---

At the Black Web, Garlick finds Vieren, hooded, with two imposing dragonborn on either side.

He tries a smile, but it's weird and nervous.
V - Where are the others?
G - What? Am I not enough?!

---

They all head into the back corridor, and into a small room.

In the room, there is :
- On the bed, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Vyrek\|Vyrek]] is tied up, still wearing his [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]] robes, with a crude rope gag. 
- A beefy guy
- [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Lyra\|Lyra]] looking very seaweathered
- An older drow lady - pirate vibes, with an ornate cane and handkerchief. 

The older woman coughs into her hanky, staining it red.

Garlick - You're all alive?! But why have you got your brother tied up?!
Lyra - He's a traitor and deserves death.
Vieren - Before we tell you the plan, we have one more surprise.

The older woman steps forward - Garlick, my child, my faithful apostle. It is I, [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Idryth\|Idryth]].
