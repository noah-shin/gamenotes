Horses are stampeding towards the gap in the wall
The druk starts charging through, dodging the horses
Stygna is trying to control the horses just a lil, gives one to Eilidh and Ratty.
Taron shoulder charges the soldier, loses momentum but takes them down without issue.

Head into the forest
Make it deeper, night has fallen, the snow is still thick
Taron places Anam down, goes 'help her!'

Anam points out a poisonous plant to use - Ratty uses it.
Stygna finds a fungus, knows it'll help
Anam applies it to herself, angrily, but does decently.

Head off to a nearby ruin of a house, the 1/8th with a chimney stack, 
Have a round of introductions.
Taron steals Eilidh's cape, and uses it as a papoose for Anam

T - Remember what happened the last time you ate or drank something?
Anam gives it back to Taron, who then downs the whole thing.
Alcohol is poisonous to her. 

Watches

Anam - I ran away from home, and I think they took us because they thought we had answers

Might head to County Greyloth - for criminal elements or priests might know her heritage

A fort nearbye - there were people strung up, then one person, then ten, then they weren't. A big storm, and a loud noise nearbye. There was one body, then, without any reason, there were loads, then they disappeared, and they were all dead. There was no-one else there, but a single set of footsteps - that began, then ended
- this was a fort in a forest with a river and a bridge (that taron punched)

then a demon appeared, a smoky creature he couldn't punch, massive, seemed like it was made from magic, very scary (Taron knows it's a ? Lurker)
it helped capture the pair, though seemed like it wanted to kill them
soldiers and a sorcerer were also there, took the pair to the fort - part of the Order


stygna busted the horses out of a garrison on the south coast, in the south east, near end of the eastern trade route, three weeks away

Head to nearby village
Taron activates a Thing and disguises themself

See a tavern - the Doe
cowboy entrance, eilidh first, then holds the door open for ratty

grab breakfast
farmer enters, muttering to himself - how am i supposed to reach the market in rattich (south of here), the fort something happened, all roads closed, 
the pass is closed, and there's no way around it because of the mountains.
could be weeks until they open it
local soldiers, but the Order are the one who told them to block it up
just last night they ordered it, must have been recent
they've put checkpoints up everywhere, like they're looking for someone
got no consideration for us folk or just need to make money

old lady doris in the corner - why don't you just try little men passage
where the little men come from
i saw that man and a little girl appear out of nowhere, and i thought they'd come from the pass
tiny little men, about 7ft tall
go into the cave to the east before the main pass, and you'll find it

---

Get kicked out of the tavern cause taron upends the bathtub over his head
head to smithy - get some daggers

the money is red cause from daeshagen mines and known as the ? money
loads of supplies end up there and give the rhodrian all their gold

sell the horses, get 400 gold (anam pulls the cute kid routine)
give 100 to styg, 5 to anam (its gonna be an allowance)
