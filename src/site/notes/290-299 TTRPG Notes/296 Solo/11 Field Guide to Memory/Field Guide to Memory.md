[[FGTM Full game.pdf]]

> Field Guide To Memory is a narrative journaling game about the meaning of legacy and memory, the mysteries of cryptozoology, and finding wonder in the natural world. Five years ago, the cryptid researcher Dr. Elizabeth Lee went missing during a field expedition.

> Renowned in her industry and a beloved public figure, Dr. Lee has now been declared legally dead. She dedicated her life to researching yet-to-be-discovered wildlife, with a particular interest in Dipodomys antilocapra (commonly known in cryptid circles as the pronghorned desert rat). You believe that you were her closest student, and Dr. Lee’s influence gave you purpose as you grew into adulthood. Now that she’s gone, you want to continue her research; but the Institute stands in your way.

> This is a physical game where you, the player, interact with the story by tying it to the material world. Through creating your character, building the story itself in the game prompts, and the creation of your final artefact of play (the journal), you will collaborate with us to create a narrative wholly unique to you and your character.

### Diaries
##### Day 1

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



##### 30/10/2022 
> [!note]- The dust on your skin
> The desert and ocean are more similar than people think. Endless waves that threaten to swallow you whole, a shifting landscape and the glory of the stars to navigate by.
> Generally, they're both pretty flat, where sun and third compete for your death.
> The only difference is during the day - in the desert you can always see the horizon.
> .
> I was in the desert and the horizon was lost to me. Dust, a rusk coloured sky, copper shafts of light catching in the dust-storm. Catching on the spines of the megaflora around me, before I realised the one by my side was an ordinary desert cacti - but towering 20 feet above me.
> Then I realised the one beyond it wasn't a cacti at all. 
> It took a moment to place, before I recognised it as a human spine - but one fit for giants. Bones and sharp plants piercing into the sky, more deadly than any rock formation I've ever seen.
> .
> Then it was never a dust storm on the horizon but a thundercloud. And it wasn't on the horizon but surrounding me, and there was no horizon to see through the rain.
> Gentle rain, nothing of the desert, where flash floods threaten to drown. 
> Sweet, nothing of the sweat or the tears I knew I had.
> Warm, and it was only then that I realised how cold the desert had been before.
> .
> I tilted my head up to drink, and I drank for an eternity. And I drank for a second and looked to the horizon, but grew distracted from movement at the base of a cacti.
> The only movement here, but for the rain.
> I stepped forwards, hair plastered to my face, and caught the movement again, darting through the protrusions in the sand.
> I started running, chasing after it, because it had something it need to tell me, but it was running *away*, and the cacti were blooming around me, violet and burgundy flowers that blocked my vision, and some of the bones stopped looking quite like spines.

##### 04/11/2022

> [!note]- Morning Routine : gentle strength training

> [!note]- Professional obstacle - Unable to speak in depth
> I go to all of these talks, and I give the same speech, a hundred times. The same people show up to half of them, this tiny circle of academics. Sure, my stuff is for the general crowd, to get them invested in the concepts of theoretical evolution, and in ensuring positive cohabitation.
> But I want to go into detail, to *develop* my work, to see them *get* somewhere? We all just sit in our armchairs and office chairs and debate the same things in endless cycles, but if I do the fieldwork then there's no income and there's no direction.
> ...
> She told me to keep speaking, to remember the people who come up to me and mention how I inspired them, about the small changes that we're able to keep making.
> To continue making them, because they're what matters. The future, and those who cannot yet speak for themselves.

##### Obituary

> [!quote] Dr Lee's life
> Dr. Elizabeth Lee, a scientist with the Institute for Theoretical Evolutions, was formally declared dead after her disappearance in 2016 on a research trip to find a new species that she had devoted her life’s work to, the Pronghorned Desert Rat.
> She was beloved by an enthusiastic and loyal audience through her public science outreach, becoming the face of accessible cryptid research.
> Her accomplishments include never forgetting a co-worker’s birthday, serving as an advi sor to the Little Citizen Scientist Club, and visiting 49 states. Despite her busy work schedule, she found time to volunteer with her neighbourhood community garden and a succulent club, where she made many lifelong friends.
> A memorial service was held on Friday at the Institute for Theoretical Evolutions.

##### 02/11

> [!bug]- Handheld console
> She laughed so hard the first time you brought you PSP on a hike with you, some fresh-faced green hiker with no understanding of electricity out in the wild.
> But you knew what you wanted, and that was a glass jar of nutella and your handheld, hooked up with a small solar charger, and the ability to while out time in the tent.
> The point of nature wasn't to get away from humanity, or electronics. It was to best learn how to take time and value both.
> You teased her about it when you brought your switch along, a couple of years ago, the two of you getting way too invested in Overcooked. She never got round to buying her own.

> [!bug]- Bigfoot vs Mothman
> It used to be that you'd argue over who was more attractive, long debates as to their existence and the general comfort of either. You liked bigfood, she wanted the twink. 
> Then you both realised it was just the rehash of the old vampires vs werewolves and the conversation took on a *whole* new level.

##### Career beginnings

> [!note]- Fellowship to track and tag the Eunected Marinus, aka the Magui.

##### From Dr Lee

> [!quote]- Frustration in research
> I don’t have hard proof that will satisfy the  Institute yet, but I suspect Dipodomys antilocapra populations are hitting  critical lows, and they deserve attention.
> They deserve to thrive.

##### Promises

> [!bug]- I'll hide them, or celebrate them. I promise to see them flourish.
> What was the promise you made to Dr. Lee?

> [!bug]- We need to know where they are in order to protect that space.
> Why is her research crucial to fulfilling it?

> [!bug] She isn't dead.

### Correspondences
##### Day 1

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



##### To the Institute for Theoretical Evolutions
> [!info]- Dear Bethany Smith
> I would appreciate the ability to talk to someone who *knew* of the Doctor's work, and therefore my own involvement within it.
> Stalling and bureaucracy do not intimidate me and I will see this conversation through its full legal recourse. 
> Hallow Han


</div></div>

##### Day 5

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



##### Thanks

> [!info]- To Melody Sparrow
> Thanks for the prompt response, and for the attached notes! It's been frustrating having to wait, but academia and bureaucracy are difficult, so I truly appreciate you reaching out and for keeping me within the loop.
> While I wait for the larger request, please do send me anything else I'm allowed to see, it means the world.
> Thanks again for treating me like a human,
> Hallow Han


</div></div>

##### Day 6

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



##### Response 

> [!note]- To Olivia,
> My name is Hallow Han, and I have no doubt you've done a lot of research already and know that I used to work with Dr Lee for a long time.
> Between you and me, she actually left all of her work to me, to continue her research. I am currently talking with the Institute in order to get it, and have been seeing progress.
> I would love to work collaboratively with you to free those notes and share them with you.
> I only ask for your support, and patience while we get them, and then decide what to do with them.
> I admire your desire to see them released to the public, but there may be a reason that she did not share them yet, and I would hate to promise something I could not fulfill.
> Sincerely,
> Hallow Han

##### 04/11 D

> [!quote]- Dreaming
> In your dream, Dr. Lee insisted you call her Elizabeth.
> The landscape around you sprang up with new growth and then melted with decay, up and down, up and down, cycling through the full stages of life and death with the dizzying speed of a time lapse sequence in a nature documentary.
> Desert flora and fauna teemed around both of you in the wake of Dr. Lee’s path as she walked toward a small cluster of holes dug into a mound of earth you recognize instantly as a pronghorn kangaroo rat colony den.
> The animals seemed calm in her presence. The plants swayed in a breeze you cannot feel.

##### 04/11 M

> [!quote]- Campus
> Where you and Dr. Lee would sometimes eat your lunches together as you discussed your internship 
 assignments, or she read you the latest fan letter from a kid who watched her PBS appearances, or she told you stories from her time exploring the country and how she fell in love with cryptozoology.

##### Dr Lee's notes

> [!note]- What do you feel? What do you remember?
> Nostalgia, bittersweet. I remember sitting alongside her as she drew similar images, field sketches of the landscapes, of the conference rooms. She always took such care with her work, even for something as simple or quick as these notes.
