##### 30/10/2022 
> [!note]- The dust on your skin
> The desert and ocean are more similar than people think. Endless waves that threaten to swallow you whole, a shifting landscape and the glory of the stars to navigate by.
> Generally, they're both pretty flat, where sun and third compete for your death.
> The only difference is during the day - in the desert you can always see the horizon.
> .
> I was in the desert and the horizon was lost to me. Dust, a rusk coloured sky, copper shafts of light catching in the dust-storm. Catching on the spines of the megaflora around me, before I realised the one by my side was an ordinary desert cacti - but towering 20 feet above me.
> Then I realised the one beyond it wasn't a cacti at all. 
> It took a moment to place, before I recognised it as a human spine - but one fit for giants. Bones and sharp plants piercing into the sky, more deadly than any rock formation I've ever seen.
> .
> Then it was never a dust storm on the horizon but a thundercloud. And it wasn't on the horizon but surrounding me, and there was no horizon to see through the rain.
> Gentle rain, nothing of the desert, where flash floods threaten to drown. 
> Sweet, nothing of the sweat or the tears I knew I had.
> Warm, and it was only then that I realised how cold the desert had been before.
> .
> I tilted my head up to drink, and I drank for an eternity. And I drank for a second and looked to the horizon, but grew distracted from movement at the base of a cacti.
> The only movement here, but for the rain.
> I stepped forwards, hair plastered to my face, and caught the movement again, darting through the protrusions in the sand.
> I started running, chasing after it, because it had something it need to tell me, but it was running *away*, and the cacti were blooming around me, violet and burgundy flowers that blocked my vision, and some of the bones stopped looking quite like spines.

##### 04/11 D

> [!quote]- Dreaming
> In your dream, Dr. Lee insisted you call her Elizabeth.
> The landscape around you sprang up with new growth and then melted with decay, up and down, up and down, cycling through the full stages of life and death with the dizzying speed of a time lapse sequence in a nature documentary.
> Desert flora and fauna teemed around both of you in the wake of Dr. Leeâ€™s path as she walked toward a small cluster of holes dug into a mound of earth you recognize instantly as a pronghorn kangaroo rat colony den.
> The animals seemed calm in her presence. The plants swayed in a breeze you cannot feel.
