##### To the Institute for Theoretical Evolutions
> [!info]- Dear Bethany Smith
> I would appreciate the ability to talk to someone who *knew* of the Doctor's work, and therefore my own involvement within it.
> Stalling and bureaucracy do not intimidate me and I will see this conversation through its full legal recourse. 
> Hallow Han

##### Thanks

> [!info]- To Melody Sparrow
> Thanks for the prompt response, and for the attached notes! It's been frustrating having to wait, but academia and bureaucracy are difficult, so I truly appreciate you reaching out and for keeping me within the loop.
> While I wait for the larger request, please do send me anything else I'm allowed to see, it means the world.
> Thanks again for treating me like a human,
> Hallow Han

##### Response 

> [!note]- To Olivia,
> My name is Hallow Han, and I have no doubt you've done a lot of research already and know that I used to work with Dr Lee for a long time.
> Between you and me, she actually left all of her work to me, to continue her research. I am currently talking with the Institute in order to get it, and have been seeing progress.
> I would love to work collaboratively with you to free those notes and share them with you.
> I only ask for your support, and patience while we get them, and then decide what to do with them.
> I admire your desire to see them released to the public, but there may be a reason that she did not share them yet, and I would hate to promise something I could not fulfill.
> Sincerely,
> Hallow Han
