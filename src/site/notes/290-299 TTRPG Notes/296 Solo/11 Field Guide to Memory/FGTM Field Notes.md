<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



##### 02/11

> [!bug]- Handheld console
> She laughed so hard the first time you brought you PSP on a hike with you, some fresh-faced green hiker with no understanding of electricity out in the wild.
> But you knew what you wanted, and that was a glass jar of nutella and your handheld, hooked up with a small solar charger, and the ability to while out time in the tent.
> The point of nature wasn't to get away from humanity, or electronics. It was to best learn how to take time and value both.
> You teased her about it when you brought your switch along, a couple of years ago, the two of you getting way too invested in Overcooked. She never got round to buying her own.

> [!bug]- Bigfoot vs Mothman
> It used to be that you'd argue over who was more attractive, long debates as to their existence and the general comfort of either. You liked bigfood, she wanted the twink. 
> Then you both realised it was just the rehash of the old vampires vs werewolves and the conversation took on a *whole* new level.

##### Promises

> [!bug]- I'll hide them, or celebrate them. I promise to see them flourish.
> What was the promise you made to Dr. Lee?

> [!bug]- We need to know where they are in order to protect that space.
> Why is her research crucial to fulfilling it?

> [!bug] She isn't dead.
