[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/290 Reference/Systems/Sys_Solo/Field Guide to Memory\|Field Guide to Memory]]

> Field Guide To Memory is a narrative journaling game about the meaning of legacy and memory, the mysteries of cryptozoology, and finding wonder in the natural world. Five years ago, the cryptid researcher Dr. Elizabeth Lee went missing during a field expedition.

> Renowned in her industry and a beloved public figure, Dr. Lee has now been declared legally dead. She dedicated her life to researching yet-to-be-discovered wildlife, with a particular interest in Dipodomys antilocapra (commonly known in cryptid circles as the pronghorned desert rat). You believe that you were her closest student, and Dr. Lee’s influence gave you purpose as you grew into adulthood. Now that she’s gone, you want to continue her research; but the Institute stands in your way.

> This is a physical game where you, the player, interact with the story by tying it to the material world. Through creating your character, building the story itself in the game prompts, and the creation of your final artefact of play (the journal), you will collaborate with us to create a narrative wholly unique to you and your character.
