> [!note]- The dust on your skin
> The desert and ocean are more similar than people think. Endless waves that threaten to swallow you whole, a shifting landscape and the glory of the stars to navigate by.
> Generally, they're both pretty flat, where sun and third compete for your death.
> The only difference is during the day - in the desert you can always see the horizon.
> .
> I was in the desert and the horizon was lost to me. Dust, a rusk coloured sky, copper shafts of light catching in the dust-storm. Catching on the spines of the megaflora around me, before I realised the one by my side was an ordinary desert cacti - but towering 20 feet above me.
> Then I realised the one beyond it wasn't a cacti at all. 
> It took a moment to place, before I recognised it as a human spine - but one fit for giants. Bones and sharp plants piercing into the sky, more deadly than any rock formation I've ever seen.
> .
> Then it was never a dust storm on the horizon but a thundercloud. And it wasn't on the horizon but surrounding me, and there was no horizon to see through the rain.
> Gentle rain, nothing of the desert, where flash floods threaten to drown. 
> Sweet, nothing of the sweat or the tears I knew I had.
> Warm, and it was only then that I realised how cold the desert had been before.
> .
> I tilted my head up to drink, and I drank for an eternity. And I drank for a second and looked to the horizon, but grew distracted from movement at the base of a cacti.
> The only movement here, but for the rain.
> I stepped forwards, hair plastered to my face, and caught the movement again, darting through the protrusions in the sand.
> I started running, chasing after it, because it had something it need to tell me, but it was running *away*, and the cacti were blooming around me, violet and burgundy flowers that blocked my vision, and some of the bones stopped looking quite like spines.

##### To the Institute for Theoretical Evolutions
> [!info]- Dear Bethany Smith
> I would appreciate the ability to talk to someone who *knew* of the Doctor's work, and therefore my own involvement within it.
> Stalling and bureaucracy do not intimidate me and I will see this conversation through its full legal recourse. 
> Hallow Han

##### Contact Calls
> [!bug]- Birdsong through the doorway

> *Where are you?*
> *I am here, I am here.*
