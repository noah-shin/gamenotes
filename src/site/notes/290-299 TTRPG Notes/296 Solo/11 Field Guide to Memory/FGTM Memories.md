##### Day 2

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



##### 02/11

> [!bug]- Handheld console
> She laughed so hard the first time you brought you PSP on a hike with you, some fresh-faced green hiker with no understanding of electricity out in the wild.
> But you knew what you wanted, and that was a glass jar of nutella and your handheld, hooked up with a small solar charger, and the ability to while out time in the tent.
> The point of nature wasn't to get away from humanity, or electronics. It was to best learn how to take time and value both.
> You teased her about it when you brought your switch along, a couple of years ago, the two of you getting way too invested in Overcooked. She never got round to buying her own.

> [!bug]- Bigfoot vs Mothman
> It used to be that you'd argue over who was more attractive, long debates as to their existence and the general comfort of either. You liked bigfood, she wanted the twink. 
> Then you both realised it was just the rehash of the old vampires vs werewolves and the conversation took on a *whole* new level.

##### 04/11 M

> [!quote]- Campus
> Where you and Dr. Lee would sometimes eat your lunches together as you discussed your internship 
 assignments, or she read you the latest fan letter from a kid who watched her PBS appearances, or she told you stories from her time exploring the country and how she fell in love with cryptozoology.

##### Dr Lee's notes

> [!note]- What do you feel? What do you remember?
> Nostalgia, bittersweet. I remember sitting alongside her as she drew similar images, field sketches of the landscapes, of the conference rooms. She always took such care with her work, even for something as simple or quick as these notes.
