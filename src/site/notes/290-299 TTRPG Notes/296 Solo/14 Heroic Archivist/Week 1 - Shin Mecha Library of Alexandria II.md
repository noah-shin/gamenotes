# Week 1
15/03/23

In 48 BCE, aspiring tyrant Julius Caesar set fire to Egyptian ships at the docks of Alexandria as part of an unimportant military manoeuvre. This fire spread out of control, consuming a portion of the city as well as the scrollery of its famous library.  

Fortunately, the Library Of Alexandria was run by both mundane staff and mages. While the flames crackled, pages shovelled scrolls into wheelbarrows and wizards held portals  open, allowing a large part of the collection to escape.  

These texts, largely concerning mage-craft and post-spiritual entities, were relocated to an interdimensional refuge: the Shin Mecha Library Of Alexandria II.  

Still, this event left a mark on the library's caretakers. If something so simple as a mundane general making a bad decision could nearly wipe out a chunk of humanity's  written knowledge, then how many good words were lost every day to smaller evils?  

The only thing to do, decided the staff of the library, was to send representatives out into the world's many eras and copy and catalogue as much as they could find.  

The masses might purge and burn and forget millions of small works, but the library could recover them and spirit them to safety.  

Today, Alexandria sits just outside of time, in a dimension all to itself, while its pages and spell-workers toil to save and catalogue texts from all across history.
