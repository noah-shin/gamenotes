### Where do you live?

Lighthouse Cove - Bell

The star is the curve of a beach, buttressed by rocks behind you when you look out to space.
The lighthouse stars at the sand but stretches up and out beyond the cliff-top. Its light flashes and turns - it's why humans think that the stars sparkle.

I'm the lighthouse keeper. I check the beaches for what - and sometimes who - ever gets washed up. Then I keep the lighthouse on.

Guests are irregular. A lighthouse is a warning, after all. Mine warns of asteroid fields and fluctuating radiation from a slowly growing black hole.

But there's two dogs and an unknown number of cats and at least one not-deer. Rake washed up a while ago and refused my offer to find him someplace else. Myrtle stayed a while, as did Dee, but most only ever pass through. 
Before they leave, they scratch their name into the wood of the building.

### What else is there?

2 planets
Sea - closer, moves very fast, flower meadow
Dune - outer, moves quickly, baking desert and tall city

Passing the time : Jump / Drift / Visit

#### 1. Jump to Sea

It's too far
Drift -> spots knitting wool

Jump to Sea

There aren't many locals, fae-like (small and tall) in appearance.
They're unsurprised to see me, as I visit regularly, but some closer friends are pleased and drag me along.
They normally get their work done - conservation of the land - by early morning, and spend the rest of the day in play or relaxing.
They're often in need of new stories, wool, and metal brackets.

Today is a market-day.
Nothing stops the day unfolding, the sea-mist of the morning gone by the time customers really start to arrive.
I set up my own stall - selling some of the things that washed up. The honor system allows people to put money in the bucket as I wander around and greet people.

#### 3. Jump to Dune

Drift -> Spots a clock

Jump to Dune

There are a lot of locals, the city stretching both up and down, underground connections across the desert. 6 meet at the centre, the hub of a lot of activity.
The people are tall and thin, with the mobility of ribbons and the feet of a camel.
I tend to fill the thin corridors, so the busy ones grow frustrated, but those in the Wheel are pleased to see me.

Today is an astronomical observation day.
One telescope runs the radius of the planet, two more from the poles to triangulate.
I sit back and tell stories of the stars they look towards.
