[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/290 Reference/Systems/Sys_Solo/Semiotician's Gambit\|Semiotician's Gambit]]

Semiotician = Fool

Virtue = 11 cups -> loving
	their most noble trait:
	Believes it enables them to act as the best of humanity
	others sometimes see them as eager to please
	exhausted for their love for everyone on the planet, but impressed by lengths of their actions

vice = R temperance -> spineless
	as they try to love everyone, they aim to always please, and have difficulty standing up for themself
	they don't recognise it as a flaw for themself, but consider it the extent of their love

goal = hierophant -> to obtain hidden knowledge
	they want to know how to save everyone
	it is hidden due to its impossibility

Name = Asphodel
	This goal is the be-all to end-all. It leaves no-one out, leaves nothing to chance.
	They're aiming to save everyone from the ever-growing dark, the fall of the stars and the dimming of the sun, from the apathy and desperation it has caused.
	They turned to Pattern Magic to find a solution - for a way to reverse time or brighten the stars or fake  way to bring back that Light.
	**The sun cannot go out.**

### 1.

Object = P coins -> Needs a banker
Condition = 8 cups -> Must be rusted
Placement = Q swords -> give/sell/sent to a ghost

Needs the banker for something rusted to give to a ghost
Needs to find an ancient coin still locked away in the oldest bank of Fairround, and return it to a ghost.
Needs to dislodge a rusted fish-hook from the back of the hand of a man who lives on the bank of a river and give it to the ghosts of the fish it killed

Obstacle = World -> the fish-hook is part of another, powerfully important pattern
If the fish-hook is removed, the main river in Concil will dry up or flood its banks, disrupting trade and travel throughout the country.

Resolve = 8+8 < 21
Asphodel hesitates; they cannot take this hook. The man from the bank laughs and offers a different fish-hook they own.
Equally rusted, but without the same power and resonance. The ghosts are not the same.
It costs them a hair, a tooth, a drop of blood and a secret. 
From now, they carry the fear of another's control, and a weaker spell.

### 2.

Object = 4 cups -> needs a gemstone
Condition = 1 wands -> must be red
Placement = 6 swords -> given to an enemy

A ruby gifted to the opposing army
An inlaid ring proposed to a rival
A diamond dipped in blood given to a sparring partner
A concession of advances for their love
An heirloom sold to an old family member
A shard of stained glass gifted to a childhood rival

Obstacle = Moon -> tempted by a risky but clever shortcut

They will save themself the trouble of finding and interacting with their enemy
Save themself from finding/sourcing/buying the precious item
They could lose the item and pattern entirely
They could hurt their current family.

Resolve = 1+6 < 18 -> failure by <6

Asphodel is discovered to be selling the heirloom by their family, who are betrayed by the selling and by who they're selling to.
Instead, they sell a smaller ruby ring to a childhood rival - they barely remember each other's names.
They think it will work, but are worried about how it may drain too much, especially with the weaker first component.

### 3.

Object = 5 cups -> Five teardrops
Condition = 5 coins -> Green
Placement = 10 wands -> make it weak

5 drops of dew from a flower's center
5 drops of freshly dyed, recently mended cloth
5 drops of sap washed by rain from the knot of a tree
5 drops of acid rain, filtered, from a statue's gaze

Obstacle = High Priestess -> A well meaning friend gets in the way
They merely want to help gather the sap, but keep mixing it with something too strong, or something too weak. It's either unwashed by the rain or only the rain.

Resolve = 5+5 > 2

With ease, Asphodel redirects their attention, and quickly takes the samples they need. They ask the friend to find trees with sizeable whorls and a natural splice, with dried sap at least five days old - since the last raid. It makes them confident, and reassured of their ability with people.

### Resolution

2+ 2- -> the pattern executed in an unexpected way

The sun stops dimming and the stars stop falling.
Asphodel breathes a sigh of relief and life returns.
But the months pass and still the sun and moon are unchanging. The lunar cycle halts and the tides fall still. The sun stays bright and the summer light doesn't fade. The day cycle passes but it is as though each day resets.
The cycle has frozen and the end won't come new, but now stagnation is all that Asphodel has.
