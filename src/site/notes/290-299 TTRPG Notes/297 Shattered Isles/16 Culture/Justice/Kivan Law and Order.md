#### Justice

Under this system, a citizen can expect to receive justice commensurate with their social status and wealth. The Inspectors are famously incorruptible and hold themselves apart from Kivan’s sprawling network of bribery, but the other institutions are bought and paid for by the powers-that-be and rarely (if ever) bite the hand that feeds them. 

The Bluecoats are under general orders to enforce the law, but in practical terms, they serve the needs of the richest and most influential groups and harass the poorest and least powerful—essentially operating as another street gang extorting the underclasses. If you’re captured by the Bluecoats or brought before a magistrate, it’s the depth of your pockets and the breadth of your political connections that will almost always decide the case, not the application of jurisprudence.

It’s often said that everyone is guilty in Kivan, so make sure you get rich before you get caught.

#### Institutions

**The Lord Governor** oversees Imperial interests in Kivan, enforces edicts from the Immortal Emperor, commands the Imperial Military garrison and war ships in the city, and breaks ties when needed on City Council measures. The Lord Governor is appointed by the Emperor. 

**The Kivan City Council** consists of six members of the nobility who draft and approve legislation, city ordinances, and public works; determine the disbursement of the city treasury; and issue taxation orders. Council seats are traditionally appointed by vote of the sitting council when a member dies or retires.

**The Ministry of Preservation** manages the provisions for the Imperium, ensuring that food and supplies are transported where they’re needed across the electro-rail lines and within the cities. They also oversee the Sparkwrights who design and maintain the lightning barriers. They are appointed by the Emperor.

**The Kivan Magistrates** issue warrants, prosecute trials, assess evidence, and pronounce judgments (there are no juries). Magistrates are appointed by the City Council.

**The City Watch** (aka “[[Bluecoats\|Bluecoats]]”) patrol the streets, “encourage compliance with the law,” capture offenders, and operate Ironhook Prison. Watch-guards are hired by the Commander of the Watch, who is appointed by the City Council.

**[[The Inspectors\|The Inspectors]]** (aka “Constables”) investigate crimes and present evidence for warrants and trials. Inspectors are appointed by the Lord Governor of the city. Inspectors are often foreigners, with no close ties within Kivan. 

There is another related institution, the **[[Spirit Wardens\|Spirit Wardens]]**, but they serve the Emperor directly and are not officially part of Kivan’s law enforcement apparatus.

#### Inspector Structure

A single organisation that has jurisdiction across all of Akaros.
The number of active individual inspectors in Akaros is a closely guarded secret.

A flat command structure, all inspectors have the same power within the organisation.
Any given inspector has the power to take over an active police case.
While the Inspectors are a legally distinct entity, Bluecoats tend to let them do what they want.

#### Underworld

The underworld factions that do survive often become what they battle against. Their power and influence corrupts them until they’re just another agent of control and oppression—feeding on the weak and vulnerable, as they once were.

And so, a cycle perpetuates: violent resistance to authority, violent response, and violent ends—or else an ascension to power and privilege; out of the gutter and onto the overlord’s perch.

The rest of the underworld is in a constant war of attrition—vicious competition among desperate gangs, each scrabbling to crawl out of misery on the backs of their victims. The landscape of criminal power constantly shifts, street to street, block to block, district to district, as the struggle for dominance rages on. 

#### Haunted City

The electroplasmic furnaces of Bellweather Crematorium burn night and day to properly dispose of all corpses recovered by the Spirit Wardens. The arcane dissolution destroys the spirit utterly, removing its echo from the ghost field and neutralizing the threat from a vengeful spirit.

Despite these efforts, however, there are still ghosts at large in Kivan. Some bodies aren’t found and destroyed soon enough, allowing the ghost to rise free of its shell. Some spirits are intentionally removed before the Wardens arrive, to be sold on the black market or distilled into spirit essence.
