# Bluecoats

The City Watch of Kivan. Known as the meanest gang in the city. Corrupt, violent, and cruel.
(See [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/20 Kivan/Order/Kivan Justice\|Kivan Justice]])

## Quirks

The Bluecoats are divided into companies by district, and they have fierce rivalries, encouraged by their superiorsâ€”often good-natured, but sometimes violent.

****

## Turf

The Bluecoats claim the whole city as their turf, but find their influence severely limited in Whitecrown, where the Imperial Military garrison holds sway under command of the Lord Governor.

## Notable Assets

Many large gangs of vicious thugs in uniform. Armored coaches and canal patrol boats. Public punishment sites (pillories, stocks, hanging cages).

****

## Faction Clocks

- [ ] 8 - Procure bigger budget, military arms & equipment

## Situation

The Bluecoats have become jealous of the elite hardware and vehicles used by the Imperial Military. They want to refit their watch-guards in heavy armor and weapons, to better strike fear into those they prey upon.
