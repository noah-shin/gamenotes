# The Cataclysm

The world was broken in the cataclysm. Most importantly, **the Gates of Death broke** unleashing spirits and Strange Forces unto the world;  the Celestial Bodies have turned strange. 

The broken world will never be made whole again.

Many things do not make sense: the black void of the skies and seas, the psychic pressure of the ghost field, and the machinations of demons and cultists are now the way of things. Better to understand these strange forces than to be consumed by them.

## Death and Strange Forces

**The Gates of Death broke** during the cataclysm, unleashing vengeful spirits and twisted horrors unto the world. Every living thing in @The Shattered Isles evolved a sensitivity to the invisible “other world” that presses always against the edges of perception – the strange dimension that erupted, known as the **ghost field**.

**When a body dies, its spirit does not disperse** as they once did long ago. It becomes a ghost: a spectral entity composed of electroplasmic vapors. It usually takes between one to three days for a ghost to become free of the corpse. It is then free to wander the world, consumed by darker and darker urges until it goes entirely mad and monstrous.

**Kivan has Spirit Wardens to deal with ghosts**. They are responsible for **destroying the spirit of those who die in the city, before it can become a ghost**. Arcane _spirit bells_ at Bellweather Crematorium ring whenever someone dies in the city. They may only be heard by those near the site of the death, and by the Spirit Wardens, whose arcane masks are attuned to the bells. A _deathseeker crow_ leaves the belfry and flies to the district where the dead may be found, circling ever closer to the corpse every minute. Wardens then remove the body to the crematorium, where it is dissolved in electroplasm to destroy the spirit before it can become a ghost.
