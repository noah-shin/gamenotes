# The Cataclysm

The Gates of Death are broken.

There is no time to wonder who, or how, whether it was some unknown working or divine judgement or -

There is no time.

The land shatters, mountains sinking and oceans parting to form new nations. The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/SI Celestial Bodies\|sky]] itself is twisted into something unrecognisable. 

Death is corrupted, spirits and terrifying horrors released into the world, new [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures\|Shattered Creatures]]. Upon passing, all people become ghosts, fighting their way out of the corpse for days before wandering the world, consumed by darker and darker urges until it goes entirely mad and monstrous.

Magic is stretched thin and the Weave is warped. Where once it was the few - those blessed by gods, born into the Weave itself, studying its mysteries to unlock new patterns, now every living thing has access to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Magic\|Shattered Magic]], and can now sense the invisible “other world” that presses always against the edges of perception – the strange dimension that itself has erupted, known as the **ghost field**.

Many things do not make sense: the black void of the skies and seas, the psychic pressure of the ghost field, and the machinations of demons and cultists are now the way of things. 
Better to understand these strange forces than to be consumed by them.
