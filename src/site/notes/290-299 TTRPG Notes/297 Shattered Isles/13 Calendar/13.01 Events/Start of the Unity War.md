Local citizens object when the Imperium moves the vast majority of its toxic leviathan blood processing to the factory town of Lockport. Rodest insisted that they are not subject tounilateral Imperial decree, claiming their figure-head king, Aldric, as their rightful ruler and demanding a withdrawal of the processing plants. The Emperor ignores them, sending workers to establish the new facilities under protection of the Imperial Military. King Aldric musters a militia force, and the Unity War begins.

Over the course of the conflict, over two thousand Rodian refugees flee Rodest, now known as the Blighted Lands, and make for the closest port - Kithwall.
