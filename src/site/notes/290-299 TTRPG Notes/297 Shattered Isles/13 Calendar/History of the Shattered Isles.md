When the sun shattered, sections now orbit themselves in the sky, some disappeared, some sunk into missing parts of the sea, and some have lingered closer to the mountain peaks of the Isles - rendering the old capital of Akharia into blistering desert, sinking the old cities of Rodest into eternal night, and dimming Kythia into twelve-hour cycles of watery light.

Out of the chaos rose the Immortal Emperor - and with them, the Imperium.  
It spread across the Shattered Isles, from the central nation of Khorotia, and their central capitol Cortis.
