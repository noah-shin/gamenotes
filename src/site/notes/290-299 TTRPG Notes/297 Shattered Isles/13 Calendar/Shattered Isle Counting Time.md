The sun was shattered in the cataclysm, plunging Kythia (and much of the world) into darkness.
Its remnant shards burn weakly in the sky at dawn and twilight, yielding only a dull glow, like the last embers in a dying fire.

## Hours

Days are divided into two parts, marked by the weak lights at dawn (roughly 6am) and dusk (roughly 6pm).
The hours are named, usually according to local custom, which varies from city to city - where most ring public chimes to mark the hours.


| Hour | Name    |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1    | Birth   |
| 2    | Thread  |
| 3    | Music   |
| 4    | Fortune |
| 5    | Hunt    |
| 6    | Stone   |
| 7    | Pearl   |
| 8    | Wine    |
| 9    | Crystal |
| 10   | Light   |
| 11   | Ash     |
| 12   | Void    | 

Days start at dust, and the hours are called the first hour of ... for after dusk, and the second hour of ... for after dawn.
Aka 1pm = Second hour of Peal (2P)

## Days

The days are named after regional custom, according to regular event of practice.

| Day | Name     |
| --- | -------- |
| 1   | Mardan   |
| 2   | Redan    |
| 3   | Kedan    |
| 4   | Caldan   |
| 5   | Dusdan   |
| 6   | Carildan | 


## Months

The official Imperial Calendar divides the year into six months of sixty days each (see the listing at right). It’s said they were
named by the Immortal Emperor himself, to honor the lands and peoples lost during the cataclysm, but there are none now living who remember them.

A month is made up of 10 weeks of six days each.

| Month | Name      |
| ----- | --------- |
| 1     | Menvet    |
| 2     | Rendvet   |
| 3     | Kalivet   |
| 4     | Ulcavet   |
| 5     | Volnisvet |
| 6     | Carilvet  | 


## Seasons

The north of Kythia, where Kivan lies, experiences three seasons—a frigid winter (during Carilvet and Menvet), a windy and rainy spring (Rendvet and Kalivet), and a stormy fall (Ulcavet and Volnisvet).

Also of note is “hunting season”—the most active time for leviathans in the northern sea, which usually lasts from late Kalivet through early Volnisvet. The leviathan hunter ships procure 80% of their hauls during this time of the year.


## Eras

**PC - Pre-Cataclysm**
Starting era

**PSC - Post-Cataclysm**
The Dark Ages between eras - a lot of time is untracked here, as the days fluctuate and seasons span weeks.

**IE - Imperial Era**
Beginning at 74 PSC, 58 of Carilvet, the calendars reset to begin at the beginning of the Imperial Calendar - the listing above.
