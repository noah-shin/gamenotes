# Kivan

Kivan is one of the most important cities in the Imperium, since it is from its port that the metal steamships of the leviathan hunters are launched, and now the city where the Immortal Emperor resides. 

Previously known as Kithwall, or Pinch Point in colloquial terms, the name changed with the Imperial presence. The city of Kivan was established over 1000 years ago as a coal mining settlement on the cold north coast of Kythia.

A community of survivors, it has withstood the breaking of the world, an attack by a titanic leviathan, massive fires, a plague, a civil war, and legions of angry ghosts.

Every square foot is covered in human construction of some kind—piled one atop another with looming towers, sprawling manors, and stacked row houses; dissected by canals and narrow twisting alleys; connected by a spiderweb of roads, bridges, and elevated walkways.

The hunters brave the far northern reaches of the Void Sea, far out of sight of land, to grapple with titanic demons of the depths and extract their precious immortal blood—the substance refined into electroplasm, the power source of civilization. All powerful noble families operate hunter ships, each commanded by the scion of their line—and it is by their fortunes at sea and the bounties of blood they capture that the fortunes of the empire wax and wane.

The savvy and the ruthless of Kivan do well to position themselves to profit from this crucial enterprise upon which so many depend—either as an ally or servant of the aristocracy, or by preying upon the corrupted rich and privileged elite.
