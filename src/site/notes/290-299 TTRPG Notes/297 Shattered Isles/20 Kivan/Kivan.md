# Kivan

Previously known as Kithwall, or Pinch Point in colloquial terms, the name changed with the Imperial presence. The city of Kivan was established over 1000 years ago as a coal mining settlement on the cold north coast of Kythia.

A community of survivors, it has withstood the breaking of the world, an attack by a titanic leviathan, massive fires, a plague, a civil war, and legions of angry ghosts.

Every square foot is covered in human construction of some kindâ€”piled one atop another with looming towers, sprawling manors, and stacked row houses; dissected by canals and narrow twisting alleys; connected by a spiderweb of roads, bridges, and elevated walkways.

## Inspirations

Gangs = Six of Crows, Peaky Blinders
City = Dishonored (without the rat plague, but with ghosts), AC Syndicate
People = Ankh-Mopork (without order) from Discworld, Leyendecker 
Heists = Locke Lamora, Leverage
Other = Bloodborne, Mistborn, Arcane
