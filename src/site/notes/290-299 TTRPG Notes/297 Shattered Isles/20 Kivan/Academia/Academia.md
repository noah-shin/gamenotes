# Academia

Some of the best educators in the empire are found in Kivan. From the high- walled towers of Kivan Academy to the stuffy classrooms of Charterhall University, if there is a mystery to be solved, a philosophy to be explored, or a schematic to be designed, some student of Kivan is probably toiling to gain course credit for it.

## Kivan Academy

Principally renowned for its services to @The Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh, the Academy campus in Whitecrown is broken into three colleges, each a pillar of understanding, representing the body, mind, and soul.

#### _**College of Imperial Science**_

The school of magistrates and political scholars. Curricula include: Law, Economics, Iruvian studies, History of Unification, and Political Sciences.

#### _**College of Naval Command**_

The chief training grounds for officers of both leviathan hunters and Imperial war ships. Curricula include: Naval Law, Void Sea Navigation, Ship Design and Operation, Fencing, Athletics, Astronomy, Alchemy, and Applied Mathematics.

#### _**College of Immortal Studies**_

This college started as a theology department, but now classes include: History, Philosophy, Spectrology, Pre-Cataclysm Studies, Music, and Theater Studies.

## Charterhall University

Charterhall University is a sprawling institution spread across Charterhall and throughout Kivan. Students enroll (often by taking loans from sponsoring merchants) to learn a trade and gain guild membership and status.

#### _**Jayan Hall of Alchemy**_

A trade school for state and private alchemy including void water filtration, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and transmutation research. Admission and graduation are bought and sold by city institutions and merchant enterprises.

#### _**Houses of Jurisprudence**_

Called Barrister Alley, this collection of homes and taverns are each dedicated to a particular magistrate who teaches law to a small throng of students. The barristers are often in competition with each other over grant funds and wealthy patronage. This has engendered a bitter rivalry between the houses.

#### _**Sparkwright Tower**_

School of research and development sponsored by rival factions the @Sparkwrights and @The Foundation. An exceptionally dangerous place due to their constant work with electrosplamic energy and the massive turbines housed in the school.

#### _**Morlan Hall of Unnatural Philosophy**_

The nexus of secret societies spawning from @The Path of Echoes, @The Forgotten Gods, and @The Church of the Ecstasy of the Flesh —each of which vie for primacy within the halls of academia as well as carry on their own cult activities in secret. 

Classes include Spectral Philosophy, Introduction to Modern Metaphysics, and Ethics in Demonology.
