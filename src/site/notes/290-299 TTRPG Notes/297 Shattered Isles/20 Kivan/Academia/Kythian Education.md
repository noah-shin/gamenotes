# Youth and Education

There is no standardized education for children. Rich or noble families hire private tutors or matrons to raise their children properly, and occasionally cart them off to a university in or beyond Kerch depending on how they important they are to the continuation of the bloodline for further learning.Â 

Everyone else passes their trades down by apprenticeship. There is the odd philanthropist who will take children or adolescents under their wing and provide them with education, although many of these scholars end up having to prove themselves to their moneyed, blooded peers constantly.
