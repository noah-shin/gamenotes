# Social Structures

Doskvol’s law and order is presided over by six institutions:

-   **The Lord Governor** oversees Imperial interests in Kivan, enforces edicts from the Immortal Emperor, commands the Imperial Military garrison and war ships in the city, and breaks ties when needed on City Council measures. The Lord Governor is appointed by the Emperor.

-   **The Kivan City Council** consists of six members of the nobility who draft and approve legislation, city ordinances, and public works; determine the disbursement of the city treasury; and issue taxation orders. Council seats are traditionally appointed by vote of the sitting council when a member dies or retires.

-   **The Ministry of Preservation** manages the provisions for the Imperium, ensuring that food and supplies are transported where they’re needed across the electro-rail lines and within the cities. They also oversee the Sparkwrights who design and maintain the lightning barriers. They are appointed by the Emperor.

-   **The Kivan Magistrates** issue warrants, prosecute trials, assess evidence, and pronounce judgments (there are no juries). Magistrates are appointed by the City Council.

-   **The City Watch** (aka “Bluecoats”) patrol the streets, “encourage compliance with the law,” capture offenders, and operate Ironhook Prison. Watch-guards are hired by the Commander of the Watch, who is appointed by the City Council.

-   **The Inspectors** (aka “Constables”) investigate crimes and present evidence for warrants and trials. Inspectors are appointed by the Lord Governor of the city. Inspectors are often foreigners, with no close ties within Kivan.

There is another related institution, the **Spirit Wardens**, but they serve the Emperor directly and are not officially part of Kivan’s law enforcement apparatus.
