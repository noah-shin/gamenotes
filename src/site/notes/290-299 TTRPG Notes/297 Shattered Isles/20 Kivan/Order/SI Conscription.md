### Conscription

The Empire does not practice conscription; joining the army, the navy, @Bluecoats and @The Brigade is a choice. 

Some families, however, elect to send their children away to apprentice under an officer to prepare them for a military or naval course in one of the universities because tuition – depending on the candidate’s recommendations and personal aptitude – is greatly subsidized by the @City Council , or can be sponsored completely by interested patrons. Some measure of status is conferred to men and women who go into such services and being in those positions also opens interesting possibilities – like, let’s say, @Leviathan Hunters . 

The @Blackfeather Order , in a practice like the @Imperial Military and their annual Examinations, regularly sends their Whispers to homes in search of children who manifest the sort of supernatural aptitude they need. Kivani are required by Imperial law to give their sons and daughters up if the Blackfeathers find what they need. They are, of course, compensated handsomely for their loss. Their children are also, in general, treated well, and are assured of as comfortable a life as  
one can get given that they are expected to be the Empire’s army against dreaded supernatural forces. Occasionally, the Blackfeathers may lean on adults with “the potential” to join them. “Gently”. 

Nobody knows who the members of the @Sparkwrights or the @Spirit Wardens are, nor how they recruit new members.
