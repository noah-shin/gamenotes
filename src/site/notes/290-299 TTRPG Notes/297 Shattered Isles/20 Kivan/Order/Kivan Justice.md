# Justice

Under this system, a citizen can expect to receive justice commensurate with their social status and wealth. 

**It’s often said that everyone is guilty in Kivan, so make sure you get rich before you get caught.**

## City Watch

The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/Bluecoats\|Bluecoats]] are under general orders to enforce the law, but in practical terms, they serve the needs of the richest and most influential groups and harass the poorest and least powerful—essentially operating as another street gang extorting the underclasses. 

If you’re captured by the Bluecoats or brought before a magistrate, it’s the depth of your pockets and the breadth of your political connections that will almost always decide the case, not the application of jurisprudence.

### Command Structure

At the top is the **Chief Commissioner of the Watch**.   
> Getting made Commander is almost like tenure - the Commander stepping down for any other reason than retirement is extremely unusual.  
> Reports directly to the City Council. 
> Chosen by council vote.

Then the **District Captains.**  
> Bitter competition exists to try and get made captain of an 'easy' district like Charterhall. 
> Appointed by the CCW. 
> One per district.

Then the **Precinct Lieutenants**, who are responsible for the day-to-day running of a single police 'building'. One per precinct.  
> Most districts have 3/4 precincts, with one acting as the HQ.

Then the **Sergeants**, who handle multiple cases at a time, responsible for the general running of things.  
> Lead 3 to 6 constables and a corporal or two. 
> Two or three per precinct.

Then the **Constables** (Bluecoats) and the **Corporals**.  

The Constables are the bottom of the barrel, standard police grunts, underpaid and unrespected. 
> Report to their first-line sergeant. 
> Twelve to fifteen per precinct.  

The Corporals have the same pay as Bluecoats, but more responsibility. 
> Shoe-ins for promotion, and effectively a sergeant's assistant. 
> Report to their sergeant. 
> One or two per sergeant.

## Inspectors

The [[Inspectors\|Inspectors]] are famously incorruptible and hold themselves apart from Kivan’s sprawling network of bribery, but the other institutions are bought and paid for by the powers-that-be and rarely (if ever) bite the hand that feeds them.

They are a single organisation that has jurisdiction across all of the Empire, where the number of active individual inspectors is a closely guarded secret.

A flat command structure, all Inspectors have the same power within the organisation. Any given inspector has the power to take over an active police case.

### Command Structure

The **Director** runs the Inspectors.   
Chosen by the previous Director and Lord Governor. If incumbent or unavailable, chosen by a vote from the Kythian High Council.    
Reports directly to the Emperor.

Then there are the **Agents**, the 'on-the-ground' inspectors, incorruptable detectives and experts of getting to the bottom of things, the **Analysts**, who process information - documents, records, deeds, if there's a paper trail, an analyst knows it happened, and the **Spies,** undercover agents, infiltrating criminal organisations and outfits. Masters of subterfuge, fearing nothing.
