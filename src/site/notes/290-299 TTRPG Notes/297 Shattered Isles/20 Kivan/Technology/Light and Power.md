# Technology

## Electroplasm

**The energetic residue distilled from ghosts and leviathan blood**. 

-   **It powers technology** (notably lightning barriers) across the city. [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/Leviathan Hunters\|Leviathan Hunters]] extract electroplasm from the massive demonic terrors in the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/15 The World/Void Sea\|Void Sea]].
-   The bodies of the dead are dissolved in electroplasm; to avoid spirits working themselves free from their corpse. 
-   When someone Attunes, they can channel nearby electroplasmic energy through their body. 

## Lightning Barriers

The cities of the empire are each encircled by crackling lightning towers to keep out the vengeful spirits and twisted horrors of the deathlands. They are powered by electroplasmic blood.

## Lights in the Eternal Darkness

After The Cataclysm brought perpetual darkness, a small hand lantern is practically a required tool for daily life in the city. Common people use simple oil lanterns, while the more well-to-do employ the most advanced miniature electroplasmic lamps, clipped to a belt to keep their hands free, mounted on the head of a walking stick, or carried by a servant lamp-bearer.

Areas of illicit dealings or ill-repute sometimes enforce a “no lamps” policy, so business may be conducted in the anonymous darkness.

## Power

Like all the great cities of the The Imperium , Kivan operates massive generators around the clock, to produce the power needed for lightning barriers as well as the thousands of electroplasmic lights that illuminate the public thoroughfares. The city is densely packed inside the ring of immense lightning towers that protect it from the murderous ghosts of the blighted Deathlands beyond.

Wealthy citizens operate their own generators and electric lights, but most people make do with simple candles and lanterns in their homes and shops. The smoke from generators, lanterns, torches, chimneys, and cook-fires chokes the air and covers the city in ash and soot.
