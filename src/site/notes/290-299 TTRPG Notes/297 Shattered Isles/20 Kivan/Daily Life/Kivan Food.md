# Food

**The bulk of cheap food in the port city of Duskwall is eel and mushroom pie**. 

**Eel** are famously resistant to taking on some of the foul accretions of the canals and the sea, and they are easy to trap.

**Mushroom** gardens are everywhere, from the poverty stricken apartment dweller’s closet planter to the wealthy aristocrat’s cultivated drawing room. “Leavings” to feed the mushrooms can be purchased on a third of the street corners of Duskwall, sold by enterprising urchins. Finer materials are sold in various specialty shops. Rich fertilizer seldom smells great, but that’s why sealable “garden cans” are fashionable. Centipedes and other vermin are often attracted to these gardens. If caught, they provide much-needed variety to the diet.

The Ministry of Darkbloom is a charity that maintains mushroom gardens in unexpected places all around the city. Most bakeries or food stores have a counter where their inexpensive goods are sold. Usually their caps, stems, centipedes, grubs, worms, and rat-meat are sold raw, but sometimes they are finished into loaves, stews, or pies first. (Whatever is left tends to be baked into a “surprise loaf” or tossed in the stewpot, then taken to the alms house.)

**Canal weed, watermoss, and algae** are collected by city authorities. They are taken from @The Void Sea and certain canals to provide renewable roughage and fodder for animals. They also provide a basic ingredient for the more desperate of the city. Duskwall officials arrange for the Department of Waterways to collect it and turn it over to the Department of Drayage, who have special wagons dedicated to moving the material to various points in the city. Anyone can collect a share. Canal weed, watermoss, and algae can be used for various soups, or ground up into gamy flour.

### The Well-Off 

If you aren’t desperate, the options become more enticing. 

Modest fields within the lightning fence produce significant amounts of **grain** through half the year, so proper flour and alcohol can be made. The Sunken Garden is an area of dammed up canals where rice is grown. Prisoners working off public service tread out the dark waters managing the paddies under the watchful eyes of Bluecoats. Eels inevitably get in, and they are harvested for food as well (if they lose the fight).

**Rodents**. Some decades ago the harrowmaze was invented, a labyrinth for mice and rats. They eat and breed and run in the sealed environment, with traps automatically catching a certain number at regular harvest times, providing a steady source of meat in a variably sized unit that can be housed in the home or a public area. Put mushroom pellets in, get rodent meat out.

**Fishing** ships ply the coastal waters daily, bringing back full nets of fish. Popular superstition figures the fish to be stray thoughts of the leviathans given form, and many are ugly enough to justify that whimsy. However, once they’ve been sorted and the poisonous ones ground up for soil treatment or disposal, the rest grace the plates or bowls of those who can afford them.

**Chickens** do well in Duskwall, and breed quickly, providing a useful source of meat. Goats are also popular, as much for their milk and guard duty as for their meat. Becoming an expert in various pairings of goat cheese and mushrooms is a cultural hobby of the city’s well-to-do.

### The Wealthy

Duskwall is a garden of culinary delights for those who can afford them. Nets and specialized hunting techniques bring a bounty of **dolphin, devilfish, squid, mussels, and all description of seafood** into the city. Culture dictates that chefs prepare them to look as close as possible to how they appeared while alive, meanwhile stuffing them and their surroundings with accents and appetizers and succulent treats.

Nothing says “family celebration!” like a devilfish platter, treats among the carefully arranged arms, the head sac full of delicious stuffing, a side of crab cheese, creamy and smooth, in a dish between the eyes. Another popular tradition is eating rich caviar out of tiny wooden shoes with a silver spoon.

**What sets the wealthy diet apart from common food is the use of radiant energy**. Centuries ago, brilliant alchemists and necromancers discovered ways to infuse electroplasmic energy into the living matrices of plants, creating beautiful living artwork that glowed with energy. The practices expanded to working with animals—first fish, then eels, devilfish, and other sea creatures. The practice is traditionally unsuccessful with mammals, and iffy at best with birds.

The glow of life energy emanating from radiant creatures is soaked up by surrounding plant life, which grows bigger and faster as a result. The wealthy tend to cultivate radiant gardens not just for the range of beautiful plants, but also because the light from those plants replaces sunlight and allows other plants nearby to flower and bear fruit. The light is dimmer, but always glowing.

Many wealthy families have their own secrets for radiant integration, and so there is a wide variety of techniques and appearances among radiant plants and animals.

**Enjoy the radiant plants and animals, but do not eat them**. Radiant poisoning is serious. The life energy that a person eats tends to root around in their echo and wake up a voice or personality of someone they killed, or a death they witnessed, or (for innocents) invites in the strongest nearby ghost voice. A psychic civil war ensues, and a Whisper must be hired to smooth out the unwanted voice and free the poisoned individual to be singular in the body once more. This usually works, but often has unpleasant side effects.

Radiant plants and animals must be disposed of by burning, as a human corpse would be, or their electroplasmic energy can cause problems in the Ghost Field. Since they almost never occur in the wild, this restriction on raising radiant plants and animals is generally not a problem.
