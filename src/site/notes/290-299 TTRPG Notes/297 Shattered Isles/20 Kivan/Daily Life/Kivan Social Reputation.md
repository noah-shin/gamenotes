# Reputation

Being connected to one’s peers or neighbors is seen as a mark of a good character in Kerch. The more people you know or the more people around who can vouch for you, the higher the chances of you being somebody who is worth dealing with. Lone wolves, hermits, and reclusive sorts are viewed with some level of suspicion. 

Privacy is something that can only be afforded to those with means, so dormitories and homes shared between several families or friends are the norm, most especially for the poorer citizens of Kivan.

Sharing space, having few scruples about physical intimacy and insisting on sprawling networks of relationships serves another practical purpose beyond cutting down on costs: there is a great deal of security to be found in numbers. Abberations from the Deathlands and the hungry dead tend to prey upon the outliers, or those who spend too much time alone and without strong defenses against otherworldly beings. Familiarity may breed contempt, but it could also potentially save someone from being victimized by a possessed loved one.

### Well Off

Life’s different for the well-heeled Kivani. They have high walls, private spirit wardens, indentured grisha, personal guards, and a lot more space. They can also afford some of the new sparkcraft technology on the market, some of which can be used to grow food beyond the standard fare of Kivan, and maintain animals larger than the goats that are the common beasts of labor. 

Space is their luxury, as is the ability to let one’s money (or influence) work for itself.
