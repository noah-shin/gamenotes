# Illness and Death

Kivan is @The Haunted City , but the Shattered Isles, as it was in our Europe, is a setting where the common cold can kill a man. The plagues and diseases that have been all but eradicated for us – the ones that loomed large in 17th to 19th century European literature – are constant, looming threats in the Kivan. Furthermore, stranger sicknesses and conditions have emerged because of the Cataclysm, and the sinister energies that it has unleashed upon the Isles.

Social class would be the most decisive factor after the dangers of the city itself, as the poor working conditions of this sort of setting plus the lack of any sort of healthcare from the city government takes quite a toll on the common populace. 

Physickers are Kivan's equivalent of doctors and surgeons. Charterhall University’s medical college is still very new, and guilds devoted towards the practice are small and have barely gotten things going. Although Kivan has recently required the doctors that they train within their cities to roam as though they were @Bluecoats and practice their profession, even families who are well off will be hard pressed to be able to pay for a doctor to care for them or their loved ones, even if they do manage to queue themselves up. The demand is high; the supply, still very low.

Old, more holistic practices of healing are popular among the labor force and the poorer sectors of the city. These folk cures are usually the only recourse that they have, and they are far more useful as preventive measures than they are as actual cures.

As a preventive measure against plagues and ghostly possession on top of there simply being no space in Kivan, only the richest families can afford to bury their dead – and they are only allowed to do that outside of both cities,  in the provincial lands of Lythia. If families have the money, however, they can arrange for private cremations of their own, and house the ashes in vessels of their choice.
