# Daily Life

Kivan is cold, rainy, and windy on most days. Its citizens bundle up in heavy coats, scarves, gloves, and hats (convenient attire for a scoundrel who needs to conceal the tools of their trade).

Just after dawn and again at twilight, the city is usually blanketed in a thick fog that obscures street lights and ruins visibility in the darkness. Many people habitually take a break during these times, staying indoors with a cup of tea to wait out the “blind hour.”

### Seasons

The north of Kythia, where Kivan lies, experiences three seasons—a frigid winter (during Carilvet and Menvet), a windy and rainy spring (Rendvet and Kalivet), and a stormy fall (Ulcavet and Volnisvet).

Also of note is “hunting season”—the most active time for leviathans in the northern sea, which usually lasts from late Kalivet through early Volnisvet. The leviathan hunter ships procure 80% of their hauls during this time of the year.
