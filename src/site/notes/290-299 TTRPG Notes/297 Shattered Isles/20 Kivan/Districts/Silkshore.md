# Silkshore

### Rose Island
(setting pdf)

An artificial island rises from amongst the canals of Silkshore. Accessible by gondola, a ring of walkways surround the central vice dens, fenced in for the safety of the crowds, though the fencing cannot keep away pickpockets, snack vendors, streetwalkers, or con artists.
