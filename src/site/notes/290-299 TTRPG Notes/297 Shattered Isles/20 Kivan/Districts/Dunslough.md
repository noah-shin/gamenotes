# Dunslough

### Eeleries and Farms

About half of Doskvolâ€™s food needs are met by imports; the other half is gathered locally from eel farms, mushroom caverns, and crops nurtured by wondrous radiant energy lamps.

### Old North Port

Before the deluge of the second century, the Kit River delta was only a shallow bog surrounding a coal mining settlement. Ships used the Old North Port to dock and re-supply before crossing the open sea to Khorotia. The obsolete port was abandoned to the [[Deathlands\|Deathlands]] when the second lightning barrier was built.

### Ironhook Prison

A towering metal fortress, where the worst (or most unlucky) criminals are incarcerated. Many are forced into labor in the Southern fields and pit-mines of Dunslough. The condemned are sent to scavenge in the deathlands.

### Dunvil Labour Camp
