# Akharia

A rich and powerful desert kingdom far to the south. A land of black deserts, obsidian mountains, and raging volcanoes. Some say that positions of power are openly held by demons, though they are often branded heretics.

The Capitol is hidden in the south of the nation, and is known as Terbani, or Spire, in the Imperial tongue.

Capital: Terbani (aka Spire)

Other major cities : U'duasha

Based off desert nations, Persia and northern Africa.
