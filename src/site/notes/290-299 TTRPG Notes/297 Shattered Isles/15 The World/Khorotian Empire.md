# Khorotian Empire

The start and the center of the The Imperium , it is a land of windswept plains, towering mountains, ageless inventions, and mixed nations. The Capitol was once that of the Imperium - [[Cortis\|Cortis]] .

Outside these Imperial cities, most Khorotians live in nomadic horse-tribes scattered across the blasted deathlands, surviving within the ruins of ancient arcane fortresses which still repel spirits, scavenging the death-lands on their ghost-hunting horses.

Capital: Cortis (aka Wisp)

Based off nomadic horse-tribes, especially those of Africa and Mongolia.
Akin to Severos
