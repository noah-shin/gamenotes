# Blighted Lands

The kingdom just across the sea from Kythia. Â 

It was once known as Rodest, but after the wreckage of the Unity War, the Blighted Lands are a cold and inhospitable place, vast swaths wreathed in eternal night. All that remains is the towering castle walls that contain its Capitol - Iniras.

Now, however, Rodest is known as the Blighted Lands, its Capitol as Deepmaw, and the forests and farms of the land are now cold mountains, rough tundra, and craterous ground.

The change is due to the Unity War , and the last nation brought under Imperial rule. Many Rodian refugees who lost their homes and jobs in the destruction of the war have come to Kivan seeking new opportunities.

Capital: Iniras (aka Deepmaw)

Based off various artic nations, such as Scandinavia, Alaska, and Eastern Russia
