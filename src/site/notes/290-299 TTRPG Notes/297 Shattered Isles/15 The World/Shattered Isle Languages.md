# Languages

#### Universal:

Tiriaan, or “Imperial,” which is considered the common tongue, and the main language of the Shattered Isles, originating from Khorotia . It’s expressive, nuanced, and verbose—perfect for sprawling poetry or meticulous legal documents.

Trader's Tongue (a trading and market language that is more a borrowing of every other language).

Sailor's Speak (the amalgamation that arises on sea, with a curious reliance on explictives and theatrics).

Thieves' Cant (a mostly symbolic and hand-spoken language used to convey information).

#### Nation Based:

Kythar - an older tongue that is not often used within @Kythia .

Hadrathi - an ancient tongue found in musty old tomes but still spoken among some people in @Akharia . Many people favor its elaborate, scathing expletives.

Rodian - clipped, direct speech can be heard wherever people from the @Blighted Lands are found.

Thanesh - a hidden and lyrical language, most often spoken in the depths of @Al'tham .

Tuath - A thousand variations exist, and is the origin of Sailor's Speak, spoken across the Free Nations of @A'otua .

Ha'on - a cryptic and runic language that is used by practitioners of older sorceries, and as a common tongue in @Chunhi .
