# The Void Sea

The sea that separates the Isles.

When the oceans turned to opaque black ink during the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/13 Calendar/13.01 History/SI Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]], a new realm of constellations appeared in the depths of the seas—millions of tiny pinpoints of light, constellations of shimmering stars far below the surface - known as the **Deeplights,** somehow clearly visible far below the waves. 

Only the bravest or most desperate of captains dare to sail beyond sight of land, into a sea as black and dark as the sky above. The vengeful ghosts that plague the land tend to shun the open ocean, but there are more terrible things prowling the deeps. To sail upon the waters is to be flung into the void—the crushing dark of black sky upon black water, stars far above and stars far below. 

Not every sailor is able to keep their sanity.

But not only must you worry for the metaphysical, but the tangible. A host of new, monstrous sea creatures have emerged from the depths with a penchant for violence and a hunger for the flesh of humans and animals alike - the [[Leviathans\|Leviathans]].
