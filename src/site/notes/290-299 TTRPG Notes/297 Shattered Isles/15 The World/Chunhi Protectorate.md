# Protectorate of Chun'hi

A distant landmass, that developed it's own ways of dealing with the Cataclysm, the Chunhi Protectorate is a semi-mythical place, far away beyond the northern Void Sea, disconnected from The Imperium.  

The Capitol is Gwang, though known as Temper within the Empire, hidden in the east of the nation. Recently, they've begun extended trade and negotiations to the Imperium, but time will tell how it will end.

People say the Hisian (rudely called “Strangers”) have demon blood in their lineage. If you choose Hisian heritage, also create a demonic telltale (like black shark eyes, feathers instead of hair, etc.) that marks your character.

Capital: Gwang (aka Temper)

Based off East Asia, particularly Korea.
