# Free Nations of A'otua

The shattered isles have many small nation states that refuse to play with the Imperium. Instead, they have branded themselves the Free Nations, and span the oceans throughout the Shattered Isles.

The people often grow up on ships and travel a lot before settling down. They’re known as corsairs and merchants who live without lightning barriers— dealing with spirits in other ways. 

Much of A'otua is scattered, set on islands small enough to pass unnoticed, on flotilla cities that dissappear into the mists of the sea, in the corners of pubs where the like-minded gather, and in the two main enclaves - in the West and East, known as Ra'uan and Mi'uan, or the Range and the Hide.

Capital: Ra'uan and Mi'uan (aka Range and Hide)

Based off Polynesian and islander nations.
