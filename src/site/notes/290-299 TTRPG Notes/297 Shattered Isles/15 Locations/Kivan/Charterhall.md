# Charterhall

Outside of the Imperial City, the greatest universities in the empire are found in Kivan. From the high walled towers of Whitecrown to the merchant class guilds of Charterhall, if there is a mystery to be solved, a philosophy to be extolled, or a schematic to be designed, some student of Kivan is toiling late in the night to gain course credit for it.

Charterhall is the site of the first major construction in the city, in the days before the cataclysm. The old wall upon which was built the first lightning barrier in the Empire still stands in partial ruin around the district.

The area is now home to the civic offices of the government including the courts, licensing and taxation offices, banks, and records archives. City officials and students at Charterhall University live here, along with the captains of Imperial industry who prefer to reside within sight of their fortunes.

### Charterhall University

Primarily composed of merchant guild sponsored programs, Charterhall University is a sprawling institution spread across the district and throughout Doskvol. Students enrol, often by taking loans from sponsoring merchants in attempt to learn a trade and gain guild membership and status.  

A dozen buildings have been converted into classrooms and dormitories for the students of this modest-seeming but nevertheless prestigious institution. The schoolâ€™s massive Sparkwright Tower, where experts of spark-craft are trained, looms huge over the district, often belching fire and smoke from the more vigorous lessons.

##### Sparkwright Tower  
School of research and development cosponsored by now rival factions the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/14 Factions/Sparkwrights\|Sparkwrights]] and the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/14 Factions/Kivan Foundation\|Kivan Foundation]]. An exceptionally dangerous school to study in due to their constant work with electrosplamic energy and the massive turbines housed in the school.
Two current projects:  
- Electroplasmic tunneling through the ghost field [Needs:  leviathan blood, ghost field cartography, test subjects]  
- Lightning Tower retrofitting of older failing towers [Needs:  leviathan blood, skilled manual labor, artisan crated  materials]  

##### Dunvil School of Sea and Stars  
Affectionately knows as The Duns, this school covers marine biology and eelery governance, naval astronomy in the pursuit of navigation, along with more esoteric humanities. As enrollment in this school drops, the Dunvil family name is increasingly diminished.  

##### Jayan Hall of Alchemy  
A trade school for state and private alchemy including void water filtration, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and transmutation research. Admission and graduation are bought and sold by city institutions and merchant enterprises.  

##### Houses of Jurisprudence  
Called Barrister Alley, this collection of homes and taverns are dedicated to a particular magistrate who teaches law to a small throng of students. The barristers are often in competition with each other over grant funds and wealthy students. This has engendered a bitter rivalry between the houses.  

##### Morlan Hall of Unnatural Philosophy  
The nexus of secret societies spawning from the Path of Echoes, Forgotten Gods, and of course the Ecstasy of the Flesh. Each of which vie for primacy within the halls of academia as well as carry on their own cult activities in secret.  
Classes taught include Spectral Philosophy, Introduction to Modern Metaphysics, and Ethics in Demonology.  

### Charter Wall  
Along the ruins of the old walls that split Charterhall are a sprawl of artist colonies. Bohemian lovers of music and sculpture, these students are typically patronized by a single individual or family who expect their charges to master their craft and make art for their edification.

Left with little oversight these romantic souls are often consumed by the wellspring of vices offered in Kivan, extending the duration of their education by months and years spent trying to pay their rent or blissed out on [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Culture/Mortality/Bloodneedle\|Bloodneedle]].

### Bellweather Creamtorium

The site of the spirit bells and the rookery for the deathseeker crows. Bodies recovered by the [[Spirit Wardens\|Spirit Wardens]] are incinerated in electroplasm here to destroy their ghosts.

### Clerk Street
The main avenue of the district is lined with imposing governmental structures of all sorts, tucked behind iron fences, patrolled by a mix of [[Bluecoats\|Bluecoats]] on the sidewalks and mounted Imperial cavalry on the grounds.

### Jayan Park

The great alchemist for whom this park is named contrived to formulate soil and seeds that could produce
real, growing trees, without sunlight or radiant energy. They are horrifically toxic to all living things and must not be touched, but they still grow beautifully here, over 100 years later.
