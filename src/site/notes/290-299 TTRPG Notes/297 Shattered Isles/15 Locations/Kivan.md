# Kivan

Kivan is one of the most important cities in the Imperium, since it is from its port that the metal steamships of the leviathan hunters are launched, and now the city where the Immortal Emperor resides. Previously known as Kithwall, or Pinch Point in colloquial terms, the name changed with the Imperial presence.

The city of Kivan was established over 1000 years ago as a coal mining settlement on the cold north coast of Kythia.
A community of survivors, it has withstood the breaking of the world, an attack by a titanic leviathan, massive fires, a plague, a civil war, and legions of angry ghosts.

Every square foot is covered in human construction of some kind—piled one atop another with looming towers, sprawling manors, and stacked row houses; dissected by canals and narrow twisting alleys; connected by a spiderweb of roads, bridges, and elevated walkways.

The hunters brave the far northern reaches of the Void Sea, far out of sight of land, to grapple with titanic demons of the depths and extract their precious immortal blood—the substance refined into electroplasm, the power source of civilization. All powerful noble families operate hunter ships, each commanded by the scion of their line—and it is by their fortunes at sea and the bounties of blood they capture that the fortunes of the empire wax and wane.

The savvy and the ruthless of Kivan do well to position themselves to profit from this crucial enterprise upon which so many depend—either as an ally or servant of the aristocracy, or by preying upon the corrupted rich and privileged elite.

## Darkness

Like all the great cities of the Imperium, Kivan operates massive generators around the clock, to produce the power needed for lightning barriers as well as the thousands of electroplasmic lights that illuminate the public thoroughfares. The city is densely packed inside the ring of immense lightning towers that protect it from the murderous ghosts of the blighted deathlands beyond.

Wealthy citizens operate their own generators and electric lights, but most people make do with simple candles and lanterns in their homes and shops. The smoke from generators, lanterns, torches, chimneys, and cook-fires chokes the air and covers the city in ash and soot.

Kivan is cold, rainy, and windy on most days. Its citizens bundle up in heavy coats, scarves, gloves, and hats (convenient attire for a scoundrel who needs to conceal the tools of their trade).

Just after dawn and again at twilight, the city is usually blanketed in a thick fog that obscures street lights and ruins visibility in the darkness. Many people habitually take a break during these times, staying indoors with a cup of tea to wait out the “blind hour.”

Because of the perpetual darkness, a small hand lantern is practically a required tool for daily life in the city. Common people use simple oil lanterns, while the more well-to-do employ the most advanced miniature electroplasmic lamps, clipped to a belt to keep their hands free, mounted on the head of a walking stick, or carried by a servant lamp-bearer.

Areas of illicit dealings or ill-repute sometimes enforce a “no lamps” policy, so business may be conducted in the anonymous darkness.

## Law and Order

#### Institutions

**The Lord Governor** oversees Imperial interests in Kivan, enforces edicts from the Immortal Emperor, commands the Imperial Military garrison and war ships in the city, and breaks ties when needed on City Council measures. The Lord Governor is appointed by the Emperor. 

**The City Council** consists of six members of the nobility who draft and approve legislation, city ordinances, and public works; determine the disbursement of the city treasury; and issue taxation orders. Council seats are traditionally appointed by vote of the sitting council when a member dies or retires.

**The Ministry of Preservation** manages the provisions for the Imperium, ensuring that food and supplies are transported where they’re needed across the electro-rail lines and within the cities. They also oversee the Sparkwrights who design and maintain the lightning barriers. They are appointed by the Emperor.

**The Magistrates** issue warrants, prosecute trials, assess evidence, and pronounce judgments (there are no juries). Magistrates are appointed by the City Council.

**The City Watch** (aka “Bluecoats”) patrol the streets, “encourage compliance with the law,” capture offenders, and operate Ironhook Prison. Watch-guards are hired by the Commander of the Watch, who is appointed by the City Council.

**The Inspectors** (aka “Constables”) investigate crimes and present evidence for warrants and trials. Inspectors are appointed by the Lord Governor of the city. Inspectors are often foreigners, with no close ties within Kivan. 

There is another related institution, the **Spirit Wardens**, but they serve the Emperor directly and are not officially part of Kivan’s law enforcement apparatus. 

#### Justice

Under this system, a citizen can expect to receive justice commensurate with their social status and wealth. The Inspectors are famously incorruptible and hold themselves apart from Kivan’s sprawling network of bribery, but the other institutions are bought and paid for by the powers-that-be and rarely (if ever) bite the hand that feeds them. 

The Bluecoats are under general orders to enforce the law, but in practical terms, they serve the needs of the richest and most influential groups and harass the poorest and least powerful—essentially operating as another street gang extorting the underclasses. If you’re captured by the Bluecoats or brought before a magistrate, it’s the depth of your pockets and the breadth of your political connections that will almost always decide the case, not the application of jurisprudence.

It’s often said that everyone is guilty in Kivan, so make sure you get rich before you get caught.

#### Underworld

The underworld factions that do survive often become what they battle against. Their power and influence corrupts them until they’re just another agent of control and oppression—feeding on the weak and vulnerable, as they once were.

And so, a cycle perpetuates: violent resistance to authority, violent response, and violent ends—or else an ascension to power and privilege; out of the gutter and onto the overlord’s perch.

The rest of the underworld is in a constant war of attrition—vicious competition among desperate gangs, each scrabbling to crawl out of misery on the backs of their victims. The landscape of criminal power constantly shifts, street to street, block to block, district to district, as the struggle for dominance rages on. 

#### Haunted City

The electroplasmic furnaces of Bellweather Crematorium burn night and day to properly dispose of all corpses recovered by the Spirit Wardens. The arcane dissolution destroys the spirit utterly, removing its echo from the ghost field and neutralizing the threat from a vengeful spirit.

Despite these efforts, however, there are still ghosts at large in Kivan. Some bodies aren’t found and destroyed soon enough, allowing the ghost to rise free of its shell. Some spirits are intentionally removed before the Wardens arrive, to be sold on the black market or distilled into spirit essence.
