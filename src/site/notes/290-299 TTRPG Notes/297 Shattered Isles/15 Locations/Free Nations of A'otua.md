# Free Nations of A'otua

The shattered isles have many small nation states that refuse to play with the Imperium. Instead, they have branded themselves the Free Nations, and span the oceans throughout the Shattered Isles.

Language: Tu'uan
Capital: Rangi (aka Range)

Based off Polynesian and islander nations.
Akin to Dagger Isles
