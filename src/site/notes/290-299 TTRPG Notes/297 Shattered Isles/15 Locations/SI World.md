# The Shattered Isles

This was once a storybook fantasy world of magic and wonders, which was destroyed and an industrial civilization was built on top of the ruins.

When the sun shattered, sections now orbit themselves in the sky, some disappeared, some sunk into missing parts of the sea, and some have lingered closer to the mountain peaks of the Isles - rendering the old capital of Akharia into blistering desert, sinking the old cities of Rodest into eternal night, and dimming Kythia into twelve-hour cycles of water light.

## Imperium
