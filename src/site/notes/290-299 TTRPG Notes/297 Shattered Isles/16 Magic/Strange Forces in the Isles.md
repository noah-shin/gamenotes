# Strange Forces

**Supernatural powers exist in the world – but they are not innate to human beings**. Humans are mortal, material, flesh-and-blood creatures, just as the rest of the natural world. To wield arcane abilities, humanity must harness strange forces in various ways:

-   The control of spiritual energies and ghosts with pseudo-scientific techniques, known as [[Spectrology\|Spectrology]].
-   Ancient occult compacts to entreat demonic or other-worldly assistance, known as [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/SI Rituals\|SI Rituals]].
-   The distillation of weird chemical mixtures, known as [[SI Alchemy\|SI Alchemy]]
-   The fusion of these disciplines with technological engineering, known as [[Sparkcraft\|Sparkcraft]].

## Attunement

During The Cataclysm, every living thing evolved a sensitivity to the “other world”, known as the _ghost field_. A human can Attune to the ghost field to perceive partially into it, to sense the echoes of real-world events captures in the field, to make a connection to ghosts and spectral energy.

Some people see attunement as a normal part of life—a new human sense that is natural and advantageous. Others see attunement as a vile act, connecting with the dark forces that once destroyed the world, and who still lurk in the shadows, always ready to prey upon the unwary or power-hungry.

## Ghost Field

**The “ghost field” is somewhat ambiguous**, by design. It’s the energy contained within the lightning barrier of the city, the echoes of events in the recent past, and the medium in which spirits exist. It’s a dangerous and strange element that should never feel safe or tame. To Attune is to connect to a crackling source of power that can easily snap out of control. 

_Bring your ideas of strange arcane energy into play and ask the other players what they think about it, too._

## Whisper

A person who’s able to summon and communicate with ghosts. Whispers are made, not born—anyone can develop arcane abilities with enough study and practice; it’s not a matter of bloodline or being “chosen.”

## Bells, Crows, & Wardens

The arcane **spirit bells** at Bellweather Crematorium ring whenever someone dies in the city. They may only be heard by those near the site of the death, and by the @Spirit Wardens, whose arcane masks are attuned to the bells. A **deathseeker crow** leaves the belfry and flies to the district where the dead may be found, circling ever closer to the corpse every minute. It’s the responsibility of the Wardens to recover the body and remove it to the crematorium, where it is dissolved in electroplasm to destroy the spirit before it can become a ghost.

## Spirit Well

A rift in the veil of reality where ghosts and other supernatural beings congregate. In ancient myth, a spawning ground for demons.
