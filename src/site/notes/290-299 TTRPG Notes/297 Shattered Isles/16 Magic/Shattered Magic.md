The Gates of Death are broken.

The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/13 Calendar/13.01 History/SI Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]] has torn the Weave of magic apart. 

Humans are mortal, material, flesh-and-blood creatures, just as the rest of the natural world.

Where once there was wizardry and sorcery and divinity, now there are nothing but remnants of old power, wielded by **Whispers**. 

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/SI Rituals\|Rituals]] that lean on the ghostfield to create effect, [[SI Alchemy\|Alchemy]] that works with chemical distillations and mystic symbology, [[Spectrology\|Spectrology]] that controls spiritual energies and ghosts with pseudo-scientific techniques, and the [[Sparkcraft\|Sparkcraft]] that fuses these with technological engineering.

## Ghost Field

Another dimension, the old Weave, something new or something corrupted, defining or explaining or understanding this field differs from person to person, place to place. It’s the energy contained within the lightning barrier of the city, the echoes of events in the recent past, and the medium in which spirits exist. It’s a dangerous and strange element that never feels safe or tame.

Now, every living thing can **Attune** to the field, perceiving partially into it, sensing the echoes of real-world events captures in the field, making a connection to ghosts and spectral energy. To Attune is to connect to a crackling source of power that can easily snap out of control. 

Some people see attunement as a normal part of life—a new human sense that is natural and advantageous. Others see attunement as a vile act, connecting with the dark forces that once destroyed the world, and who still lurk in the shadows, always ready to prey upon the unwary or power-hungry.

## Spirit Well

A rift in the veil of reality, perhaps between this plane and the ghostfield, where [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures\|Shattered Creatures]] congregate. In ancient myth, they were a spawning ground for demons.
