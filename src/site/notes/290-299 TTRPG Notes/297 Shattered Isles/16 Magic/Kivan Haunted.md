# The Haunted City

The electroplasmic furnaces of Bellweather Crematorium burn night and day to properly dispose of all corpses recovered by the Spirit Wardens. The arcane dissolution destroys the spirit utterly, removing its echo from the ghost field and neutralizing the threat from a vengeful spirit.

Despite these efforts, however, there are still ghosts at large in Kivan. Some bodies aren’t found and destroyed soon enough, allowing the ghost to rise free of its shell. Some spirits are intentionally removed before the Wardens arrive, to be sold on the black market or distilled into spirit essence.

Rogue spirits crave what all dead things crave: the sweet essence of life. Some seek it by pursuing what was lost when they died, mindlessly repeating meaningless actions from life. Others lure the unwary into a cold, withering embrace. The most ancient spirits are said to have even more sinister ways of acquiring what they desire.

Every citizen of Kivan has had at least one harrowing encounter with a rogue spirit, sometimes many more. Most spectral encounters in the city fall into one of five types:

-   **Echoes** are “loops” of behavior captured in the ghost field, repeating over and over. They have no will of their own, but are still dangerous because of the electrical discharge of their plasmic forms. They sometimes spontaneously manifest at the site of an extremely violent event, whether or not death was involved.
-   **Specters** are malevolent spirits seeking to possess a victim to drain its essence and to take vengeance upon those who they believe wronged them in life.
-   **Horrors** are non-human electroplasmic entities that live within the ghost field. They’re very rare within the city, but are common in the death lands beyond the lightning barriers.
-   **Reconciled** are ghosts that have stayed sane and do not crave life essence or vengeance as Specters do. Reconciled are extremely rare—some spectrologists don’t believe they exist at all.
-   **Spirit Wells** are rifts in the veil of reality where ghosts and other supernatural beings congregate to draw energy. In ancient myth, a spawning ground for demons.

These entities, while terrifying and strange, are a fact of life in the dark world of the Empire. Citizens still go about their business amidst supernatural horrors everyday, clutching their spiritbane charms, mumbling a half-remembered invocation to a forgotten god, and never hesitating to call upon the services of a professional Whisper if the situation becomes dire.
