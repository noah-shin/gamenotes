The Gates of Death are broken, and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/20 Kivan/Kivan\|Kivan]] has filled with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures\|Shattered Creatures]] and [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Magic\|Shattered Magic]].

There are many who work to stabilise the city and reassure the population, from the freelancing Whisper to the official Spirit Wardens. 

Despite these efforts, however, there are still ghosts at large in Kivan. Some bodies aren’t found and destroyed soon enough, allowing the ghost to rise free of its shell. Some spirits are intentionally removed before the Wardens arrive, to be sold on the black market or distilled into spirit essence.

## Whisper

Those who summon and communicate with the ghosts they remove are known as **Whispers**. They are made, not born—anyone can develop arcane abilities with enough study and practice; it’s not a matter of bloodline or being “chosen.”

## Warnings

The arcane **spirit bells** at [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/Bellweather Crematorium\|Bellweather Crematorium]] ring whenever someone dies in the city. They may only be heard by those near the site of the death, and by the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/Spirit Wardens\|Spirit Wardens]], whose arcane masks are attuned to the bells. 

A **deathseeker crow** then leaves the belfry and flies to the district where the dead may be found, circling ever closer to the corpse every minute.

## Spirit Wardens

An official Imperial position, the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/Spirit Wardens\|Spirit Wardens]] are responsible for destroying the spirit of those who die in the city, before it can become a ghost. They recover the body and remove it to the crematorium, where it is dissolved in electroplasm to destroy the spirit before it can become a ghost.

The electroplasmic furnaces of Bellweather Crematorium burn night and day to properly dispose of all corpses recovered by the Spirit Wardens. The arcane dissolution destroys the spirit utterly, removing its echo from the ghost field and neutralizing the threat from a vengeful spirit.
