## Ghost

A spirit without a body, craving life essence and vengeance on its earthly enemies. Composed of semi-solid electroplasmic vapor. Suffers limited harm from physical attacks, but is vulnerable to electricity and arcane powers.

## Devils

In Doskvol, common parlance calls anything supernatural or disturbing a “devil.” Ghosts, demons, witches, sorcerers, and the summoned horrors of ancient rituals are all devils. “Take the devil’s bargain,” people say, when they know something is too good to be true.

## Demons

**Demons are supernatural beings with electroplasm in their blood.** Some scholars believe that demons are the first beings, brought into existence at the origin of reality, as the primal forces of the universe coalesced into the elements of nature. Each demon strain is thus connected to an element. There are demons of the earth, demons of flame and smoke, demons of the sea, demons of the sky and stars, etc.

Before the events that caused the cataclysm, it’s said that the Immortal Emperor bound most of the demons and imprisoned them in the dark, hidden places of the world. Only a few escaped this subjugation, and scholars believe that it was these few that broke the Gates of Death in their rebellion and freed the greatest of their kind—the leviathans—to shatter the world.

Unlike humans, demons are not echoed in the ghost field—their blood contains electroplasmic essence, which gives them eternal life. Demons are corporeal creatures, not spirits, though they are extremely difficult to kill. Most appear as monstrous humanoids with physical features related to their element. A sea demon is covered in dark scales and has black shark eyes, a fire demon has flesh of smoldering coal with fires burning within, and so on. Some demons can transmute into their corresponding element and a few can disguise themselves with a convincing human illusion.

The exceptions are the massive leviathans. No one knows the true shape of these horrors that dwarf the largest iron ships. Only a small portion may be glimpsed when they crest the surface of the ink-dark sea, drawn by electroplasmic lures.

Each demon is obsessed with its dark desire (mayhem, manipulation, corruption, etc.), which it attempts to satisfy in every way it can, usually by preying on humans. A demon is living embodiment of its dark desire, not a “person” in a normal sense.

### Demonic Powers

Every demon has these supernatural abilities:

-   **Strength & Speed:** Demons possess monstrous strength—they can dent steel with their bare hands, shatter stones, etc. They are also extremely quick, able to out-pace the swiftest steed.
-   **Arcane Speech:** Demons speak the ancient tongue of sorcery, which every human ear can discern. They may also speak arcane effects into existence according to the elemental affinity and power level of the demon (the Whisper’s **Tempest** ability is thought to be a lesser form of this power).
-   **Strange Travel:** A demon may teleport from one site of their elemental affinity to another. For example, a sea demon could teleport from the water in a fountain to a canal under a manor house on the other side of town. The greater the distance, the more powerful the demon must be. A demon may bring others with them when they travel. A demon may also be summoned in this way, by forcing it to travel to the summoner’s ritual presentation of their element.
-   **Remote Viewing:** A demon may use their elemental affinity to achieve clairvoyance. For example, a fire demon could gaze into a fireplace and see out of the cook-stove at the Bluecoat tower down the lane. The greater the distance, the more powerful the demon must be.

## Possessed 

A living body containing two (or more) spirits.

## Hollow

A living body without a spirit. Usually dim-witted and easily controlled.

## Hull

**A spark-craft body animated by a bound spirit**. A hull is a rare and advanced form of arcane technology that uses a captured spirit to animate a spark-craft frame. Some wealthy citizens employ hulls as bodyguards or servants. The @Spirit Wardens have been known to use specialized hulls to assist in tracking and capturing rogue spirits or demons in the city.

Hulls come in three general frame sizes. Small frames are about the size of a house cat. Medium frames are the size of a human. Large frames are the size of a wagon.

As cutting-edge technology, hulls are often fitted with a variety of mechanical marvels dreamed up by visionary tinkerers, such as electroplasmic levitation, sound recording and playback via phonograph, and other wondrous things.

## Vampires

**A dead body animated and sustained by a spirit.** When a possessing spirit bonds with a living body, it becomes a vampire. This can happen if a ghost possesses a victim for too long, thereby destroying its original spirit, or when a hollow is specially prepared for the purpose by ancient ritual.

Scholars of the arcane say that vampirism breaks the chain of being. Over time, a vampire’s spirit essence diffuses fully into the body, giving it physical immortality while at the same time destroying its echo in the spirit realm “beyond the black mirror.” Some have argued that this is the only way to escape the damnation of madness that otherwise inflicts all the ghosts denied passage through the gates of death. (A vampirism movement in the 6th century of the Imperium achieved significant popularity before it was eradicated by the Spirit Wardens.)

Vampires are exceedingly rare today. Most people consider them to be legendary or mythical. When the Spirit Wardens do discover one, they take great pains to destroy it in secret so as not to disturb the peace. In legend, vampires were destroyed by the rays of the sun. Since the sun was shattered by the cataclysm, this is no longer possible. Spirit Wardens must capture the vampire and disintegrate it in electroplasm according to a specific arcane method in order to destroy it.

A vampire sustains its energy by feeding on life essence from a living being. In fables, vampires drank blood to accomplish this, but this is not typical. Each vampire feeds on essence in its own way—leaving a distinct telltale sign on its victim afterwards. A vampire can easily detect these signs in order to locate their victims again for feeding, or to take care to avoid feeding on the chosen prey of another vampire.

## Summoned Horrors

Some ancient rituals of the forgotten gods can rend the veil between worlds and usher in an alien creature that serves the deity. Horrors such as these rarely resemble any normal living thing—they may appear as a drifting toxic cloud, a twisting mass of pulsing viscera, floating crystalline shards, or other bizarre configurations.

Horrors are intensely powerful and highly resistant to harm. They may only persist in this world for a short time, however. Their alien forms cannot sustain life for long outside their native realm and they inevitably decay to dust or ooze in the span of a few hours or days.

Ghosts, demons, and summoned horrors can be terrifying to behold. They cause most people who see them to freeze up or flee. PCs may resist these effects.
