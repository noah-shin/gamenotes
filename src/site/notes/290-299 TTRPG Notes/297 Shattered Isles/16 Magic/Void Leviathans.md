# Leviathans

Eldritch horrors that roam the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/15 The World/Void Sea\|Void Sea]], these creatures are immense, immortal, and utterly confusing. 

# History

No-one knows when the first Leviathans were harvested - for tales of their beaching and destruction are as old as the Cataclysm. Kivan itself was attacked by one or more leviathans, as reported in conflicting attacks.

But in 256 IE, Alchemist Setral refined their blood and viscera, and managed to use it as fuel. 

Still, the process was expensive, messy, and dangerous. Harvesting and processing started, but on a relatively small-scale endeavour, even on dedicated Kythian hunting ships. If a sizable community was able to harvest blood and viscera from one or two great leviathans per hunting season, alongside a periodic catch of butcherfish and lesser creatures, they would consider themselves to be incredibly fortunate and extremely wealthy in trade goods. 

Surprisingly little is known about this crucial era, due to the Great Conflagration of 314 IE and Imperial decrees aimed at safeguarding the few remaining written accounts. The limited reports available suggest that leviathans were occasionally hunted from shore or in littoral waters prior to the advent of industrial hunting (see the account of Casdannick the Left Hand in Blades in the Dark, p.160). 

The construction of dedicated leviathan-hunting vessels, however, marked a major shift.  

The uses for leviathan blood have grown exponentially, thanks the Imperium’s push for industrialization, mechanization, lighting, barrier-building, inter-continental shipping, rail transport, and so on. Consequently the moderate harvests of the past are no longer sufficient to sustain contemporary rates of consumption.

The hunters brave the far northern reaches of the Void Sea, far out of sight of land, to grapple with titanic demons of the depths and extract their precious immortal blood—the substance refined into electroplasm, the power source of civilization. All powerful noble families operate hunter ships, each commanded by the scion of their line—and it is by their fortunes at sea and the bounties of blood they capture that the fortunes of the empire wax and wane.

The savvy and the ruthless of Kivan do well to position themselves to profit from this crucial enterprise upon which so many depend—either as an ally or servant of the aristocracy, or by preying upon the corrupted rich and privileged elite.

## Leviathan Hunting

When a leviathan is sighted, then, hundreds of sailors descend into a smattering of lesser boats, ready to traverse the churning stretch of sea between the leviathan ship and the leviathan itself. And while some of these sailors will likely not make it back, in their stead will return many times their bodyweight in drained leviathan blood, spongy tissue, stringy tendons, chipped shell fragments, bone shards, and the occasionally mysterious rarity like a handful of ebony scales or a tuft of feathery material. 

All of these are taken in a frenzy of slashing, stabbing, ripping, and siphoning by sailors who are often counting down the seconds until they will flee back to the boats, hopefully with their lives intact. This harvest is never sufficient to actually slay a true leviathan, even if it amounts to the mass of a score of butcherfish. 

Indeed, the same several dozen leviathans are sighted over and over, occasionally with the evidence of a recent harvest on their backs, yet to regrow. This abundance of demonic creature flesh,  
though, means that—so far at least—over-harvesting does not appear to be a major problem.  

They also seem to continually spawn lesser creatures at a rate that seems inconsistent with either hatching or live birth. In truth, a leviathan’s lesser offspring are not spawned so much as emitted from the great beasts’ bodies, particularly from wounds or other places where their raw flesh touches the ocean’s dark waters. 

Indeed, one of the dangers encountered during leviathan hunting is the sudden appearance of unexpected and unfamiliar creatures that can quickly swarm and become overwhelming. 

All experienced leviathan hunters agree, though, that the beasts are becoming craftier and more difficult to pursue. Centuries ago, I’m told, you could drive a butcherfish into shallow water by banging on a metal pot and chasing it in a small skiff. No longer. 

Indeed, it’s becoming rarer to catch anything larger than your forearm without someone losing at least a pint of blood. This becomes even clearer in hunting for the greater leviathans, which now spend longer periods underwater, rarely surfacing, and sometimes seem to be intentionally goading ships and their crews into increasingly risky and desperate actions. 

Compared to even a few decades ago, it now takes significantly more effort to harvest the same amount of raw blood and viscera.  

# Tracking

Perhaps the most significant Imperial contribution to leviathan hunting, aside from the construction of the great hunting ships, is transforming leviathan augury from an illicit whisper’s art into more of a science. 

Anticipating the future positions of gigantic oceanic demons requires the most advanced mathematical calculations and complex electroplasmic instruments. In addition, the measured use of refined leviathan blood as a tool for sensing its unprocessed, still-living counterpart has dramatically increased the range and accuracy of modern augury.  

The Akharians find our divination methods to be not of their liking, of course, but their relationship with demonic entities lends their augury a different flavor. Occasionally you will encounter a rare vessel that prefers to employ an A'otuan or Rodian augur of the old school, one who tracks leviathans by reading “demon sign,” sailing through traditional hunting grounds, and observing the wind and waves. Such methods are slower and less exact, but—on the other hand—are more time-tested and reliable for captains with sufficient patience.  

# Processing

Modern commercial processing is a complex multi-step process in which raw blood and viscera are cataloged, separated, re-combined in specific quantities, blended into a paste, pressed to create a liquid extract, heated to specific temperatures for set amounts of time, and then more carefully strained through a series off filters. 

In addition to the general, multi-use leviathan blood that we are all familiar with, more specialized substances are also created from rare parts or unique recipes, to be issued to a handful of Imperial scientists and military armorers.  

Aside from the basic dangers of being around leviathan parts, blood processing facilities also create a variety of byproducts that must be disposed of, whether by burying leftover sludge in designated pits or simply hosing residues off the machines that then soak into the ground. 

The former, now-disassembled processing facilities in Barrowcleft still contain some signs of these poisons. The Imperial decree to move all processing to Lockport thankfully prevented further contamination of Rodest. But, as we all know, the Blighted Lands didn’t take too kindly to this move, and that grumbling continues today, even after the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/13 Calendar/13.01 History/End of the Unity War\|End of the Unity War]] made it clear that the Emperor’s decision was not up for debate.
