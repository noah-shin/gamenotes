# Spectral Encounters

Within a city, and protected by the lightning barriers, encounters with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures#Spirits\|Shattered Creatures#Spirits]] are rarer, with four main types:

-   **Echoes** are “loops” of behavior captured in the ghost field, repeating over and over. They have no will of their own, but are still dangerous because of the electrical discharge of their plasmic forms. They sometimes spontaneously manifest at the site of an extremely violent event, whether or not death was involved.

-   **Specters** are malevolent spirits seeking to possess a victim to drain its essence and to take vengeance upon those who they believe wronged them in life.

-   **Horrors** are non-human electroplasmic entities that live within the ghost field. They’re very rare within the city, but are common in the death lands beyond the lightning barriers.

-   **Reconciled** are ghosts that have stayed sane and do not crave life essence or vengeance as Specters do. Reconciled are extremely rare—some spectrologists don’t believe they exist at all.
