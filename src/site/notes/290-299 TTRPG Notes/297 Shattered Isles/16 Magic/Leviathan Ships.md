Within a hundred years of the first refining, the Imperial Navy had invested heavily in large scale  
ship-building for the institutionalized leviathan hunt, including—almost immediately, by all accounts—ironclad ships powered by electroplasm. 

These were originally converted from existing merchant and navy vessels, heavy plating added to their hulls to withstand moderate contact with demon carapaces. However, dedicated leviathan-hunting ships were soon being built in the shipyards of Kivan.  

More recently, shipbuilding has shifted. As space in Doskvol harbor is increasingly taken up by facilities for docking and maintaining the immense hunting ships and for transferring refined electroplasm to the rail lines, other supporting facilities have been moved elsewhere. 

The vast majority of leviathan hunting vessels are now constructed in the gargantuan drydocks just  
east of Southport. Around the same time, the refinement industry was moved to Lockport, sparking the recent Unity War.  

Note that Akharian hunting ships—the 4-vessel Sky Fleet of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/House Khayat\|House Khayat]] and the 3-vessel Star Fleet of House Ankhuset—are not direct copies of Imperial designs but are slightly smaller and swifter. 

There is even some talk of the Imperium buying Akharian-made hunting ships, since Kythia’s shipyards have been churning out well-armed naval vessels over the past several years, and hunting ships—which take up so much space—have a hard time getting on the docket.
