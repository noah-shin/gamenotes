The Gates of Death are broken.

The [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/13 Calendar/13.01 History/SI Cataclysm\|Cataclysm]] has corrupted the ability to move on, creating [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures#Spirits\|Spirits]]. The sea has filled with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Void Leviathans\|Void Leviathans]]. Out of the Deathlands and the dark emerge [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures#Demons\|Demons]]. Out of myth come the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures#Vampires\|Vampires]]. Out of human greed are [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Shattered Creatures#Summoned Horrors\|Summoned Horrors]]

But these entities, while terrifying and strange, are a fact of life in the dark world of the Empire, and every citizen of Kivan has at least one harrowing [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Spectral Encounter\|Spectral Encounter]]. There are plenty of ways to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Fight in the Dark\|Fight in the Dark]], and earn money while doing so. Citizens still go about their business amidst supernatural horrors everyday, clutching their spiritbane charms, mumbling a half-remembered invocation to a forgotten god, and never hesitating to call upon the services of a professional Whisper if the situation becomes dire.

# Devils

In Kivan, common parlance calls anything supernatural or disturbing a “devil.” Ghosts, demons, witches, sorcerers, and the summoned horrors of ancient rituals are all devils. “Take the devil’s bargain,” people say, when they know something is too good to be true.

## Spirits

When a body dies, its spirit does not disperse as they once did long ago. For three days, they fight to be free of their corpse, before it becomes a **ghost**: a spectral entity composed of electroplasmic vapors.

Rogue spirits crave what all dead things crave: the sweet essence of life. Some seek it by pursuing what was lost when they died, mindlessly repeating meaningless actions from life. Others lure the unwary into a cold, withering embrace, or look for vengeance on its earthly enemies.. The most ancient spirits are said to have even more sinister ways of acquiring what they desire. 

### Possessed

But where there are spirits, there are bodies. There are the **Possessed**, a living body containing two (or more) spirits. There are **Hollows**, living bodies without spirits. 

### Hull

There are **Hulls**, a spark-craft body animated by a bound spirit. 

A rare and advanced form of arcane technology that uses a captured spirit to animate a spark-craft frame. Some wealthy citizens employ hulls as bodyguards or servants. The Spirit Wardens have been known to use specialized hulls to assist in tracking and capturing rogue spirits or demons in the city.

As cutting-edge technology, hulls are often fitted with a variety of mechanical marvels dreamed up by visionary tinkerers, such as electroplasmic levitation, sound recording and playback via phonograph, and other wondrous things.

Hulls come in three general frame sizes. Small frames are about the size of a house cat. Medium frames are the size of a human. Large frames are the size of a wagon.

## Vampires

And there are **Vampires**, dead bodies animated and sustained by a spirit.

When a possessing spirit bonds with a living body, it becomes a vampire. This can happen if a ghost possesses a victim for too long, thereby destroying its original spirit, or when a hollow is specially prepared for the purpose by ancient ritual.

Scholars of the arcane say that vampirism breaks the chain of being. Over time, a vampire’s spirit essence diffuses fully into the body, giving it physical immortality while at the same time destroying its echo in the spirit realm “beyond the black mirror.” Some have argued that this is the only way to escape the damnation of madness that otherwise inflicts all the ghosts denied passage through the gates of death. (A vampirism movement in the 6th century of the Imperium achieved significant popularity before it was eradicated by the Spirit Wardens.)

Vampires are exceedingly rare today. Most people consider them to be legendary or mythical. When the Spirit Wardens do discover one, they take great pains to destroy it in secret so as not to disturb the peace. 

In legend, vampires were destroyed by the rays of the sun. Since the sun was shattered by the cataclysm, this is no longer possible. Spirit Wardens must capture the vampire and disintegrate it in electroplasm according to a specific arcane method in order to destroy it.

A vampire sustains its energy by feeding on life essence from a living being. In fables, vampires drank blood to accomplish this, but this is not typical. Each vampire feeds on essence in its own way—leaving a distinct telltale sign on its victim afterwards. A vampire can easily detect these signs in order to locate their victims again for feeding, or to take care to avoid feeding on the chosen prey of another vampire.

## Demons

Supernatural beings with electroplasm in their blood, some  scholars believe that demons are the first beings, brought into existence at the origin of reality, as the primal forces of the universe coalesced into the elements of nature. Unlike humans, demons are not echoed in the ghost field—their blood contains electroplasmic essence, which gives them eternal life. However, they are still corporeal - just very difficult to kill.

Before the events that caused the cataclysm, it’s said that the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/11 NPCs/Immortal Emperor\|Immortal Emperor]] bound most of the demons and imprisoned them in the dark, hidden places of the world. Only a few escaped this subjugation, and scholars believe that it was these few that broke the Gates of Death in their rebellion and freed the greatest of their kind—the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/16 Magic/Void Leviathans\|Void Leviathans]]—to shatter the world.

Each demon strain is connected to an element. There are demons of the earth, demons of flame and smoke, demons of the sea, demons of the sky and stars, etc. Most appear as monstrous humanoids with physical features related to their element. A sea demon is covered in dark scales and has black shark eyes, a fire demon has flesh of smoldering coal with fires burning within, and so on. Some demons can transmute into their corresponding element and a few can disguise themselves with a convincing human illusion.

Each demon is obsessed with its dark desire (mayhem, manipulation, corruption, etc.), which it attempts to satisfy in every way it can, usually by preying on humans. A demon is living embodiment of its dark desire, not a “person” in a normal sense.

### Demonic Powers

Every demon has these supernatural abilities:

-   **Strength & Speed:** Demons possess monstrous strength—they can dent steel with their bare hands, shatter stones, etc. They are also extremely quick, able to out-pace the swiftest steed.
-   **Arcane Speech:** Demons speak the ancient tongue of sorcery, which every human ear can discern. They may also speak arcane effects into existence according to the elemental affinity and power level of the demon (the Whisper’s **Tempest** ability is thought to be a lesser form of this power).
-   **Strange Travel:** A demon may teleport from one site of their elemental affinity to another. For example, a sea demon could teleport from the water in a fountain to a canal under a manor house on the other side of town. The greater the distance, the more powerful the demon must be. A demon may bring others with them when they travel. A demon may also be summoned in this way, by forcing it to travel to the summoner’s ritual presentation of their element.
-   **Remote Viewing:** A demon may use their elemental affinity to achieve clairvoyance. For example, a fire demon could gaze into a fireplace and see out of the cook-stove at the Bluecoat tower down the lane. The greater the distance, the more powerful the demon must be.

## Summoned Horrors

But where there are monsters, so too are there people who wish to use them.

Some ancient rituals of the forgotten gods can rend the veil between worlds and usher in an alien creature that serves the deity. Horrors such as these rarely resemble any normal living thing—they may appear as a drifting toxic cloud, a twisting mass of pulsing viscera, floating crystalline shards, or other bizarre configurations, causing most people who see them to freeze up or flee.

Horrors are intensely powerful and highly resistant to harm. They may only persist in this world for a short time, however. Their alien forms cannot sustain life for long outside their native realm and they inevitably decay to dust or ooze in the span of a few hours or days.
