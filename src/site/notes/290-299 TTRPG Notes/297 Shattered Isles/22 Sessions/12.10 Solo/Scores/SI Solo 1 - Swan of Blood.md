# Swan of Blood 

Arden Brace approached the Ashes, looking for information about the [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/297 Shattered Isles/19 Factions/Stygian Ring\|Stygian Ring]].
He was left in the cold, and was always jealous of their group. Now, he desires to take some small part of what they had - a gem that should grant eternal life.

Type: Social
Infiltrate the Swan of Blood club on one of their occult nights, see if any rumours of the Whispers still remain.

Location: Six Towers - Swan of Blood club

Load: Medium

Engagement: 6
Controlled
- Target is lower tier
- Contingent on the Ring still holding relevance there, and their gear being in the building
- Daring - Flint is going in solo

## Part I

Flint - and he is Flint tonight, face half tucked under their large floppy hat, all invitations unaddressed (however you manage to obtain one, well, then you belong past the front door) - surveys the crowd. Nobles with no disguises, citizens looking for a thrill, criminals and curiosities all, people fill the few open rooms of the club, waiting for their turn to be led on a horror story tour.
