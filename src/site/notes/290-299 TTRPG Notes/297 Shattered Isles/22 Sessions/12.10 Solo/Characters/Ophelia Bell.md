Slide : Subterfuge
Hunt / Command / Skirmish / Finesse

A'otuan : Aligned with their political endeavours
Faction: Free Traders

Noble : A noble from the now defenct Rodian House of Bells
They found themselves on the sea at a young age, and willingly became a Slide for the Free Traders.

Vice : Weird
Bell has seen too much on the oceans, and in the Blighted Lands, to not be curious. It's just curiosity though, I swear...

Friend : Nyryx, a courtesan
The best secrets are those whispered on the cusp of sleep, and the pair's partnership grew into something closer to sisterhood.

Rival : Harker, a Jail Bird
Another A'otuan, Harker is determined to besmirch the Free Nations name, and bring down all their work with him.
