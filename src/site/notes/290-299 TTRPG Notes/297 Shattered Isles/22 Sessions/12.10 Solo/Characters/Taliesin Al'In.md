Hound : Survivor
Prowl, Skirmish, Wreck, Command

Rodian : A soldier with no war to fight.

Military : Special Forces sniper
Initially conscripted, then stayed on long after the army was forcibly disbanded.

Vice : Stupor
They're tired, and rest seems long off. Acrick, a power dealer in Barrowcleft, supplies them with whatever they need to sleep through the night, then stay awake again the next morning.

Rival : Steiner, an assassin
A competitor, but also they just simply disagree with each other's methodology. Steiner is it for the flash, for the fame, for the gold. Tal, Tal is tired.

Friend : Melvir, a physicker
Melvir has a bed set aside for Tal - for those their bringing in to be dissapeared, or for the fact that Tal never seems to realise they're injured before they step through Melvir's doors.
