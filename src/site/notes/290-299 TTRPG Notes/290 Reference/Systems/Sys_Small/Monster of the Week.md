Most people don’t believe in monsters, but you know the truth. They’re real, and it’s your task to bring them down. This revised edition of _Monster of the Week_ brings that adventure to life.

_Monster of the Week_ is a standalone action-horror RPG for 3-5 people. Hunt high school beasties a la _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, travel the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of _Supernatural_, or head up the government investigation like Mulder and Scully.
