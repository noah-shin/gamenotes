The Dungeons and Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It’s about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.

This overhaul is designed as a _Star Wars_ reskinning of the core Dungeons and Dragons experience. The rules are generally the same, and so an experienced player of 5th Edition should have no trouble jumping right in to a _Star Wars_ themed campaign. For the less experienced player, this Introduction will cover the basics of the 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons, appropriately reskinned for the setting.

## Review

★★★★⚝ 

Incredible layout, formatting, variety of rules, built ontop of 5e to make something intuitive.
Only complaint is I'd prefer it wasn't a 5e hack but developed more mechanics to tell its own story
