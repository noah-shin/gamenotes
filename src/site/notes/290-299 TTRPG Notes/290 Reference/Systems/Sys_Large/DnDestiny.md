Imagine a world of swords and sorcery, of great kings and vicious tyrants, their armies clashing on the battlefield, blades clanging and storms of arrows flying. Imagine epic heroes facing down a fire-breathing dragon in the ruin of an ancient castle. Imagine a world filled with mystery, wonder, and magic, with an adventure waiting around every turn.

_Dungeons & Destiny_ isn’t too different from that world. You just need to reload your sword.

## Review

★★★⚝⚝ 

Despite the clunky formatting, poor explanation of the rules, and over-reliance on the players knowing DnD 5e, the game is multi-faceted and a work of love, that ties in all the incredible things about playing Destiny with ttrpgs, and brings it to the table.
