**The** **Archive of Forgotten Dreamings** collects fragments of stories, personal fantasies, fever dreams, and memories that were misplaced by their owners and never reclaimed. The fragile nature of these forgotten dreamings necessitates careful handling, but a new, experimental archival process allows us share the beauty of these ephemeral specimens with you.

Some of the forgotten dreamings are notably more delicate than others. Our archivists observed rapid deterioration in specimens that are not anchored to their extant worlds, and now ask for your assistance in creating tethers to our world to prevent them from fading away entirely. The more of us there are to study these specimens, the stronger their tethers will be, increasing the library’s chances of preserving those pieces of the archive that are currently in immediate danger of disappearing.

## Review

★★★★⚝ 

Paywalled, and in its formative stages, but such a creative idea and cannot wait to see how the story sprouts and grows wings
