Solitaire is a collection of six games for you, the solitary player. Each game reflects the world within and without, whether you are contemplating two stages of your own transformation, a choice you must make by the water, delicately placing seeds within rich soil, or staring into the heart of a candle flame as you let memories from your previous life slide away.
