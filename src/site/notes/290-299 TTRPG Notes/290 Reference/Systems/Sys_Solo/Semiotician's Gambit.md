## Aka Twenty-Two Brown Birds

_You are a semiotician, a student of pattern magic at the New Archives in the north of Hieron, and you want something more than you have ever wanted anything before. The World may not end if you do not get it, but you feel as if yours might. So you turn to the Pattern, and you ask it what it requires, and you make your play…_

_**Semiotician's Gambit**_ is a single-player Friends at the Table fan RPG about grand intentions, desperate measures, and the whims of fortune. You will draw Tarot cards to create a conflicted magician, seek components, and overcome obstacles to cast a daring spell that could change everything.

## Review

★★★★★ ⚝⚝⚝⚝⚝ 

The perfect balance of enabling you to write your own story and engage with the mechanics, without relying purely on tables or just making it all up yourself.

Loved how the cards were weaved in, and really liked the way the mechanics worked! 

Had _atrocious_ luck the first two rounds, with a low virtue and high vice, but came in clutch with the last round and the final resolution draw - but the story of my Semiotician is definitely one that's going to be going around my head until I play again and tell up something new to replace it!
