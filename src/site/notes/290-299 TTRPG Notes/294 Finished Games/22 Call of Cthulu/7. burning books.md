wheatcroft immediately goes to cover the body up again

dr grey : we were sent by the dean and the student is asleep and the body was uncovered and is that how you run things down here?!

he falls for it
wheatcroft : i was under the impression that the body was to be - anyway, why were you sent here?

the med student scurries away 
wheatcroft : i was given the same orders as the dean, to be discreet, but i can try to be of assistance?

dr grey flashes the autoposy, asking why there were inaccuracies
wheatcroft immediately looks guilty : i feel quite awful, but the dean did request that i keep everything secret, and for me to falsify these records

leanthra persuades him to tell us the full story, and for us to take his stuff

as wheatcroft rifles through the stuff, brandy notices that next to the desk on the wall is a disconnected receiver - and can hear some whispering from it
brandy goes to pick it up
wheatcroft : please ! don't pick that up !
brandy : ... why?
wheatcroft, uncharacteristically emotional and scared : it's broken - my students have been scared stiff for a week or so, having heard noises or something through it

he passes us the bag
leanthra and adam follow him to the office
he pulls out an unmarked file from a locked drawer
	the actual autopsy report

he had multiple seizures and a heart attack that instantly killed him
there was some thermal damage to his eyes and brain - like a boiling of matter
even his gut flora was burnt and dead
multiple organ failures

his university files said he weighed less than he did at his time of death (110lbs to 138lbs)

wheatcroft : i had a strange boy try to break in a couple hours ago, though he didn't make it very far

---

erich : are you gonna touch the phone?
brandy : why don't you give it a try?

erich listens to it
like a lot of voices all at once, beginning to root into his ear, his brain, becoming full of whispers
can hear a panicked male voice - there's worms, seething in the walls, in the papers, get them off of me
an elderly female voice - you have to let him out, you have to, please, let him out

erich crushes the phone in his hand, ripping it out the wall and throwing it across the room
it sounds like a rope being pulled taut, and then snapping (sort of like a noose)
before the whispers die down

---

we walk back in to the sight
brandy : it broke. erich went to fix it and it floo

---

head back to the office

start going through the clothing
the wallet has no money, only an invoice

there is also a crumpled up piece of paper hidden away

![Handout_10.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/294%20Finished%20Games/22%20Call%20of%20Cthulu/Handout_10.png)

adam remembers cecil hunter
he had a bit of a rep for being eccentric
four years ago, he was expelled for mis-conduct of some kind
the reason was very hush-hush - which isn't that odd because the uni wanted to avoid drama
but the connection between the two men is very odd and unusual

---

we head to the history office
a simple space, with a very ornate fireplace

brandy grabs anthony
he has nothing new to give
but excited at the thought of being published in her column, he scribbles down some new stuff
- fallon has stolen the papers
- amelia is a witch, killed lieter and has the papers
- fallon and roach are lovers and conduct black magic rituals on the quad
- keziah mason, look her up

adam is trying to go in
it opens, with a loud creak
amelia, from an adjoining room : hello? 

amelia : his notes would normally be kept in his desk, but when i found the body, most of the personal notes were scattered and in the fireplace. his professional ones are in the filing cabinet

amelia : there were several pages (in the witch trial docs) that were nonsensical - geometric diagrams, etc
amelia : i didn't see any remnants of the leather from the binding in the fireplace
amelia : the dean brought then from the estate to give to leiter
amelia : i was his primary assistant, the rest working on admin whilst i worked on the witch trial docs
(leanthra can tell it's a partial truth)

brandy : was keziah mason mentioned?
adam flashes brandy a look
amelia : she was one of the witches the documents mentioned. they called and hanged for being a child killer.
amelia : the drawings in the docs were apparently from her

erich : did any of these documents have to do with worms?
amelia : they were very formulaic, but the margins of one had a beast, perhaps a wolf, made of snakes, or worms
erich : oh, i once read a strange poem of the trials and worms (lying badly)

amelia : i last saw some them when i was locking up on the 23rd - the night that he passed away. i left the office around 5pm, and the documents were in his desk. 
amelia : he wasn't in that night, and had been erratic for the past week, hardly in at all
amelia : he felt like he was being watched, so he didn't stay in one place for very long

amelia : he had a professional rivalry w/ roach, and nothing else
(leanthra can tell it's a partial truth)

amelia : he had a bit of a gambling problem
amelia : i also saw an old student, cecil hunter, leaving the office several times - either very early or late in the evening

amelia : i tried to maintain a professional relationship w/ prof leiter
(there's a subtle nasty undercutting sentiment - perhaps on the *tried*)

---

amelia and leanthra head into amelia's office
dr grey can tell the handwriting is the same as the anonymous note accusing leiter

brandy closes the door
can see a mounted mirror on the wall behind it - horribly broken, but no glass on floor
behind the mirror can see a patch where the paint looks burnt
brandy swears, for a second, that she could see something in one of the shards - pink and sharp teeth

erich and brandy get the mirror down
and can tell that some of the shards of glass aren't just broken but also burnt/bubbled

the body had been found infront of the desk, collapsed back away from the mirror

---

amelia tells leanthra about the documents
the ones written by mason were very round, written in a suspicious red ink

leanthra slides over the anonymous note
amelia's eye twitches

amelia : i was the only person in regular contact with prof leiter, other than cecil
amelia : there was an energy about him that had me ... concerned, whenever he left the office, but i didn't press
amelia : i haven't seen him in the past week (since his admission)

amelia : he did keep detailed journals, but i believe most were put into the fireplace with great haste

amelia : i left my note on the night of the 23rd
amelia : i was beginning to feel unsafe, based on his previous advances

---

brandy peeks her head into the office
can see a tiny burn mark on the matching inner wall

amelia : i cleaned up the pieces

amelia : only one other student sticks out to me - this weird guy, anthony
amelia : but he never saw the papers, never mind touched them

---

meanwhile
adam is looking for secret compartments 
	can't find anything in the desk
	the filing cabinets are unlocked - but primarily containing student records - grabs the ones on anthony 
 
anthony is failing his classes, his essays are too outlandish and conspiratorial
can't find anything on cecil

the fireplace is mostly ash
the least burnt piece is from a journal
![Handout_2.png](/img/user/290-299%20TTRPG%20Notes/294%20Finished%20Games/22%20Call%20of%20Cthulu/Handout_2.png)

otherwise the office is very empty

---

erich examines the office locks to see if they were broken into

they look ordinary
then, looking through the keyhold, he can see the office
but late at night, and leiter scrambling to empty his desk and throwing them into the fireplace
he pulls open a drawer, and its the leather-bound notes
the strap peels off, and the pages flick out without his movement
he screams, eyes rolling back, drops the book, stumbles to the mirror, as though he doesn't want to but he is moving anyway, and when he gets there the mirror shatters with this intense heat

erich believes that there's glass in his face, and he's got to get rid of it

adam immediately goes to help him
amelia comes out, and leanthra can see the corner of her mouth ticks up, something knowing in her eyes

leanthra : what's with the smug look?
amelia fakes being scared - adam buys it

---

brandy threatens her more
she runs into her office and starts screaming for help

adam and leanthra say that she's a mental breakdown based on the grief and shock
students who came running at the cries for help are now sent to get dr john oakes - tutor and physician

she's immediately taken to be committed
has progressed to genuine hysterics, rather than purely feigned
dr oakes sedates her and she is taken away

after everyone disperses
adam immediately goes to search amelia's office
he yanks open a locked drawer - and finds the documents

he immediately opens the book - looking for shit regarding his research (proving the philosopher's stone)

it's a set of court records re the witch trials
written primarily by the lead judge - jeremy hobhouse
there were 18 witches tried, all hanged, including keziah mason
who used the blood of children to commune with a god - the crawling chaos
he then sees the drawings - on suspicious parchment made of suspicious ink, in an unknown languages
there are drawings of the wolf of worms, and a tall skinny gaunt man with horns

adam immediately tries deciphering the diagrams
but gets nothing - and instead it looks as though the diagrams are rotating and writhing, the paper is pulsing, the drawing of the man elongates, the wolf starts shifting

adam gets mania - the papers *belong to him*, and only he is allowed to see/have/read them
he slams it shut and puts it into his blazer

he immediately starts getting Mad - refusing to hand it over to anyone else
despite the questions or requests
erich grapples adam, restraining him _very_ completely
adam is futilely struggling, yelling out curses and threats in english and korean

leanthra takes the book, securing the strap
as she does so, a piece of paper falls out - describing a banishing ritual

---

they begin the banishment ritual

adam's hands begin to throb with a mysterious burning sensative - where they touched the book

he tries to escape, fails

a bunch of worms start trickling from the book
there is a faint growling from the pages

brandy hits adam over the head with a heavy glass paperweight
adam crumples like a puppet
there is a slow but rapidly growing pool of blood coming from his head

brandy lights the book on fire
but not fast enough, and from the pages, a writhing mass of dark red shimmering worms, like dying embers or boiling blood, in the vague shape of a wolf head rises

the head is looking right at erich
and it feels like pepper spray in his eyes
the flesh is burning away from his eyes and face
losing sanity as his soul itself sets alight
sees his mother holding the book - instead of leanthra
she steps forward (even as leanthra doesn't), feeling like worms passing through him

the book continues to burn into ashes
and the worms fall to the floor, shrivelling and dying
the smell of burnt flesh fills the air
the creature seemingly destroyed

---

leanthra goes to help adam
adam awakes, slowly, blinking up at leanthra as she holds a blazer to his head to stem the bleeding

brandy unlocks the door
and outside the door is anthony, looking wide-eyed
brandy : do you have my paper?
he holds up an empty sheet
brandy writes - you were right
and hands it back
he nods, satisfied : i always knew she was a witch
