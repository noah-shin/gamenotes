Character Creation

---

Everyone in Roan's tractor, heading through the elements
A pale figure rears up in the road, as though from nowhere
	A woman in white, eyes and mouth open in a scream.
Roan pulls to a stop, avoiding the woman.

Tia jumps out, goes to talk to her.
Woman grabs her - 'Please help me, my grandfather, he's being robbed!'
woman - emilia 

there's also a faint white light in the forest that then disappears between lightning flashes

get her into the tractor
she's still mumbling to herself
something about how the robbers were pointed in the direction of a chest
randomly throws the phrase 'dead light' in there
and the term 'sin eater'0

arthur notices that she has a necklace with a coin - with a strange script on it

arrive at the cottage just down the road
she gets quieter the closer we get

front door is swinging open and shut
some of the local trees look burnt - almost like lightning strikes
an abandoned crowbar in the mud near the porch
someone slipped and feel right before the porch

muddy bootprints leading in - and then into the door infront of us
tia can hear a static mumbling (more static  than mumbling, close to electricity or sparking)
comes from deeper in the house

open the door
sight of a violent altercation - two dead bodies
fireplace, next to a wooden chest, with the top cracked open

emilia yells again at the sight - 'grandfather!'
grandfather on his knees, slumped against a chair, bloody shoulder
young man in early 20s, features contorted with agony to the point of being unrecognisable, his joints almost self-dislocated, lower half of his body is ashes, upper body is blood blotches like his veins had exploded

arthur collapses at the sight
tia can see a nearby recently fired shotgun, and burglar mask
broken red wax seal on the chest edge

something distinctly funeral about this chest
the inside of the box is burnt, and crispy - should be broken
the seal border is a spiral, and the seal reads 
- 'here lies the sin eater'

tia pulls out a bible from the bookshelf - had been sticking out

hands it out to arthur, in the corridor
jedidiah opens the leather bound bible, inscription -'may god have mercy on this physician. doctob godfrey webb'
inscription is very old
full of pages of extra notes that scatter when the bible is opened
one page is a long list of dates that stretch back years

in the soup reflection is a startling white light - coming from the window outside the kitchen
from the trees, glowing like an unnatural white fire, is a giant serpent, curling towards the cottage
