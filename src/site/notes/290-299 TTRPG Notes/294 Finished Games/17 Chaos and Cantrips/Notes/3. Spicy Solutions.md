gammon still holding arty's wrist
she snarls at him (proper snarl), and tries to break his hold
he runs away lmao

smell smoke as we get closer to the seafood stall - just putting out a fire looking quite panicked
basil and bitty can't see anyone who looks suspicious - some people looking confused at the sky

almost looks like someone dropped a small bomb
no evidence of anything magical at the fire start
but some unusual magic around the edges
arty thinks they _are_ associated with the creatures from the mountains
basil has heard stories of invisible blue monkeys that steal your food and like fruit
sort of a folk story

basil approaches a fish stall stray cat
big invisible fast birds in the sky that the cat couldn't catch
_fanny mcgee on the other end of the market_

some of the hot sauces from those same remote mountainous locations

head to cassim
itty gets a taste test of different hot sauces
homegrown - family secret
stall is secretly bigger
crates on one wall, desk in the middle, two used camping beds
basil heads to the big Pepper crate - three straw lined cages w/ persimmons in them
arty - desk - business records, nothing too untoward
john - some boxes just full of persimmons, and his hand touches something invisible and fluffy
hear some chittering and tiny claws
Responsibility of collecting the shipments has moved to Cassim over the past few months

head to teymo and tell her our suspicions - that cassim brought them here and used them to disrupt the two biggest stalls - the seafood and noodles
head to cassim and annoy him into letting himself being brought in

lamia gives us 100gp to split between us (basil has it rn)
100/5=20 | 5 from itty to john, and 5 from bitty to arty

level up to lvl 3!

John is made of oil - thieves tools in his fingers - is an _experiment_
Arty is a vamp - has fangs and drinks blood

John: I was stolen from my village as a child and turn into a weapon
a warforged with silicon skin
tested on by the enemy
arty helped them escape
