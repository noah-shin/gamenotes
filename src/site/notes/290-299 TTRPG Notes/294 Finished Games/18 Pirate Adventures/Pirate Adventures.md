legends tells of a hidden vault hidden deep in the most treacherous oceans - containing everything your heart's greatest desire, guarded by an evil unfathomable

in the past century, people have begun writing it off, believing it to be nothing more than a table

the Illustrious Dream - the best ship money can buy
obsidian tipped bolts, a pristine and ornate ship
but what a motley crew, the best of the best

asirite shard - what an old kobold told us could open the vault

captain - mol / astra
first mate - lauren / thea
sailing master/navigation - anna / neoma
gunner powder monkey - jess / lynx
carpenter/surgeon - noah / trismigestus
also have : greg, lucy, scarlet, tamara

crew all playing dice
astra is dreaming, stood ontop of a fluffy cloud, in the distance, on the clouds, is a grand citadel
starts running straight towards it

gambling ends, lift the cups
banging sound from the captain's quarters
astra, mindlessly walking around the ship
faint humming sound from the distance

astra feels like something is pulling them out of the sky
they jump overboard, many hands grabbing them and pulling them down into the watery depths

two weird creatures, bodies of women, wings and snake tail and mouth full of fangs

fight

ghostly spectral ship rises up out of the water
hundreds more of these creatures are ontop of this new ship
one key figure in dark at the back, commanding over them

we start running away

the other captain
bottom half is octopus, skin dark blue, four arms, hair like snakes
she starts speaking into directly inside our heads "we have the power to destroy each of you. there need not be blood spilt, just give us what we want"
"we cannot let the wrong hands get hold of it. if you let the creature out of the vault, it will destroy us and our race"
"you must know, you're approaching the site of the vault, the sunken temple. "
"you believe you have the power to stop a god?"
astra : dont it once before
"it looks like you _might_ be strong enough, to deal with the vault"
neoma : maybe if we had help?
astra : my god bows to me
"my children and me, we do not wish to even speak its name"
- God - Nyogth-Ynath
"i will let you pass with the shard, you have twelve hours, then my children will feast on your flesh"

astra plants a magic bean into a plant pot
its so heavy it starts dragging astra into the ocean

we all jump over, sinking down
astra grabs 5 fruit
neoma casts water breathing on everyone

we go deeper and deeper - find a grand decrepit temple
place the shard into a section of the door
patterns glow and move, before there's a strange portal

hand goes directly through, warm air on the other side
thea passes through
