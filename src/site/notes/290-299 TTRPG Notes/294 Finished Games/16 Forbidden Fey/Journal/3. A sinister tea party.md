Detect magic on doorway - antecedents on at base of well

The wing feather glows w/ magic - same as floor, trail leading into the dark

head down corridor
infront of us - another small shimmering bird flitting around - almost like its asking us to follow it
goes down for a while, evens out, then steps up - surrounded by glowing sigils
say similar things about the antecedents - then a sage and directions pointing up
head up steps, then wooden panel in the way
- trap door (we're underneath it(, stuck in place from years of disuse
- hubub of voices behind it, woman talking to several people at once, with exchange of coin
- storeroom, very dark, old tomes and glass bottles

indie recognises it as maggie's potion shop - 
shop's been around as long as we can remember
maggie is new to us#
used to be an old lady named 'elee' ?
sage = magic potion shop maker person

try to sneak through the shop
sorrel and orrin invisible, try to sneak through
orrin caught by maggie


maggie : recently took a trip through the // dynasty, took some herbs, and several people were rather peeved about that
maggie: where are your companions, i have every kind of magic detection on my doors

indie tells her abotu the trapdoor
maggie had no idea it was there

orrin recognises the god's name
has own leather-bound book - three years old, engraved w/ a big tree w/ green snake wrapped around it

flips back to page w/ wing 
m: someone had this in elysium but it was broken
m: i couldn't figure it out before i was expelled

sorrel insight
cassian reaches up to their heart at the mention

some pages have a language we can't read (celestial)
