Sas
Heads to Silk House
– Mostly same folk, not the Smile Mask or Keto
– On Mask's table, piece of paper and spray of blood
—Letter written in blood ; Be seeing you :)
– Overhears 'There's always the dead carts. You want to get in with [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Alveirynn\|Alveirynn]]'
— By a group (Arven?)
— Dead carts – reps of [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Do'ghym\|Do'ghym]] and Alveirynn, sweeping through Shelith for dead and dying
Sas attempts to follow them
– Elven lady looks exactly like Arven
– Until they cross the bridge, wind picks up, sees two normal arms (instead of the wood of before for one)

Heads to Rug Shop (super drab area)
– Normal level of decay, with 'weeping spot' mushrooms (mildly poisonous, don't step on them)
– Calls out '[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Cutter\|Cutter]]?'
– Mushrooms receed, creating a path into the shop
– Hooded figure, thick blue smoke, he sighs 'Knew you'd find me here kid'
— Mushroom man! Mushroom head w/ black eyes, smoking wooden pipe, bleeding profusely
Sas ; That guild was yours! They can't run you out!
Cutter ; They can, the shit they're running, they're going to take the underground from the Collectors
– Stuff from the surface, from the Feywild
– Cutter has a festering frost-bitten wound
— C probs saved Sas' life more times than she can count
– C looks tired, mushrooms creeping back
C ; Find the contact, shut it down

Heads to Church of Lloth
– Spiraling staircases, no backdoor
– Sas' room is in the basement
– Sister is in the church session
– One hall w/ lavish mural of history of the city
– In their room, there's a part of a black cloth w/ a white symbol painted/spilled on
— Sas copies the symbol and takes the cloth, destroying the bag

Fabia
Heads to Ekel for armour
– FAILS investigations, ends up in a shady area
– Gets MUGGED, needs money to get to the next level
– Finds merchant heading up the stairs
— Takes out pan flute, starts playing 'toss a coin', 25 perf check
– Starts busking, gathering money in the cloak, now a lil famous ;3
— Eyes on you, maybe not for the best reasons

Passes through into Elvila
– Surprisingly nice shops, amethyst made water fountain in center of courtyard
– Remember's there's a blacksmiths here
– Reachs out to ask someone, ends up infront of a group of 6 [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Arcice\|Arcice]] soldiers w/ MM in center
— The group look at Fabia in disgust, walk away
– Goes to grab money from the bottom of the fountain
— Fails a Wis save, something resisting her taking the money
— Hears 'Don't touch my hoard', -15 psychic HP

Heads to their work, looks like a big rock
– Rich jewelry, broad shouldered dwarf, blonde hair and yellow eyes
Dwarf ; You're late
Fabia ; You would not believe the day I've had
Jeremy tells him the vague beats
– Fabia takes their jewelry repair stuff to the back

Eos
Talking w/ [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Arnet\|Arnet]]
E ; You heard anything about murders? Unusual targets or by a kobold and the eldest Shalvyl son?
A ; There's an execution planned. MM and Patron are in talks, MM wants him dead
Eos heads to NE block, House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]], but also hopefully to run into Atton?

Atton
Heads home
– Uses Echo to get past the tiers
– House Shav – most simple in design, 2 round towers on either side w/ two larger towers behind it, looming silver door above curling pair of staircases
– In courtyard, youngest sister sparring with the guard
– Father, Kelor, watching from a distances, scarred to shit
— Looks like he's seen A, then turns his gaze

Makes a shadow self run in the other direction
– All guards go after it (though one is dubious)
Corridor is lined w/ swords from previous MMs
– Heads up the stairs, invisibility drops, now stumbling down the corridor
– Pushes open fancy double doors to Mother's private training quarters (opens them Aragorn style)
— She trains her daughters, not you, so Atton's not been in here a lot
– Mother currently training eldest sister, pushes her to the floor, doesn't look at Atton, wipes the blood off her sword
— Room is opposite mirrors and window wall over the weeping waters
A ; What did I do wrong?
– He throws his glaive on the floor infront of her
MM ; Killing our men, with a kobold, then helping the kobold escape? You've never been more of an embaressment
A ; I don't remember it, not for the usual reasons. I've never lied to you, and I don't intend to start
– Fails persuasion, she hits him w/ base of her sword, -21 HP
– Knocks him prone, kicks him, -6HP
– A switches w/ Echo to 20ft away, pulls off main piece of armour
— Reveals arm brace, beneath which is black running through his arm, constantly altering, reacting to the room around him like shadows
A ; I'm not going to fight you, I never am. I'm simply giving you everything I am, and if you don't want anything to do with me, be done with me.
– MM considers if he possess any worth to her
MM ; I don't think I do need anything to do with you.
– MM throws her sword to skewer him to the mirrored wall, -14 HP
– He goes unconscious, sees a 'familiar figure' enter the room – grotesque appearance, cloaked, hunched, stringy hair

Eos
Heads to [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Desor\|Desor]], most psychically imposing council house
As they pass Shalvyl, spots familiar spiderling carriage, embellished w/ Do'ghym sigil
Eos waits outside it, sends small spider into the building.
– At top of corridor, sees Do'ghym guards.
– Spider climbs the stairs, sees Head Wizard Alvir
