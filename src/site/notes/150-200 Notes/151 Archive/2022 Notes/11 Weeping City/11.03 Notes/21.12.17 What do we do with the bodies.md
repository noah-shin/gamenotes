Sasrene
  -  A small, winged figure, tucked behind her hair; glowing a faint purple with 
      conjuration magics, flecked with strange, shifting white swirls and threads of 
      colour - like the Northern Lights.
  -  The rapier on her hip glows black and grey with necromancy magics. 

Atton
  -  The gaudy House [[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/House/Shavlyl\|Shavlyl]] insignia on his gauntlet glows faintly with too many 
      different magics to clearly discern.
  -  The glaive on his back glows black and grey with necromancy magics.

[[290-299 TTRPG Notes/295 Current Games/11 Weeping City/Wiki/Person/Fabia\|Fabia]]
  -  Jeremy glows purple with conjuration magics.

Garlick
  -  The blue ring around one of Garlick’s fingers glows a bright purple with 
      conjuration magics; the aura seems unstable - pulsing.
  -  Something from within Garlick’s coat - key-shaped, tucked away - glows a faint 
      purple with conjuration magics.

other

The table fashioned out of a glossy, green mushroom between the beds glows black and grey with necromancy magics.
