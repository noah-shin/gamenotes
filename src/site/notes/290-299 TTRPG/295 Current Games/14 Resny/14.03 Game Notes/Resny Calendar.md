#### 01 Where the Hell Are We

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





Aaravos – Molly – Vampire Assasin (tries hard to keep up appearances) Vasrak – Anna – Drow warlock – otherworldly appearance / looking for their patron Eva – Lauren – Rogue/Bard – hood and cowl Oesna – Shelby – druid air genasi – green cloak / gold lining / three gems in their wrist Blank – Noah – doll bard – medium sized porcelain w/ a haegum / locket and vial around their neck

Items V – large shield stretched over a rib cage (?) A – small burlap bag attached to belt E – longbow made of vocal chords O – small corked bottle filled w/ swirling darkness B – vial of red liquid

We come through the mists, escaping a previous adventure Approach a small collection of houses There's a guy whistling / shadowing figures in houses (wearing porcelain doll masks) Resny existed on the material plane w/ multiple past tragedies How long has it been snowing? Hunched tall thin limp, black stringy hair, unblinking – Mila – the guy whistling – the builder – The first place he built was in the Marketplace – voice loops, no knowledge of the outside world – (mind haziness?)

Lady pulls AVO into house w/ shadowy figures 'were you followed? Did HE see you?' – named Penny man 'you already took him, didn't you? We don't have anymore' Lost their son Ruben Both have voice loops (temporary time loss? or a script?)

Shuffling behind wall by the stairs They're both wearing the doll masks Penny 'what masks?' (unaware their wearing them?) E tries to message – staticy nothing in her head – E is frightened O tries to take the mask off – gets necrotic energy (sealed on? grown on?) grooves in the wall, like a small door contains a CHILD – 'my party, my friends, my mother, all of them. It killed them' – named Melton – sister Etta. – last saw them in the marketplace

A makes husband kill Penny O tries divination : Where are the missing kids? – in a dark place / in cages / under where we can't find them – divination weaker here? / info provided as dark disembodied voices – potentially a children's rhyme? — Melton doesn't know what those are Ask Melton good hiding spots – only knows those in and around the houses

Marketplace : M points at largest north shop – Soviv & Sons Doll Shoppe other shops : butcher / weaving mill / blacksmith / apocathery / candles / church

Whats in the church? Barrels outside the doll shop?

Well in center of market – figures & body parts face down in the water figure : goat skull mask / 4 horned goat head insignia in white thread on the cloack – speak w/ dead fails. (why? undead, or asked something in the past ten days?) – mask comes off w/out problem – detect magic : body (necromancy. many spells)

Barrels at the shop full of porcelain dolls (new) Doll shop – dust, nasty, some collapsed shelves. Can hear a soft sobbing from inside.

#### 2 What's in a Soul

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





Church – more of a barnhouse Has misted windows, red painted bound hands on the door, lots of 'red wood flooring'

Dollshop – no-one owns it Aaravos enters with a bagn Melton's fam were taken by The Dollmaker DM has the Wand of Orcus (M's parents were coming to retrieve the wand and destroy it?) Faint constant sound of crying – from the dolls but also everywhere

Left workshop – jar of eyes, open scrolls, pulled apart stuffed doll – counter – framed pictures / papers

DOLLS W POISON NEEDLES UNDER SHELVES – needle of soul transfer

can you understand me – where am I – barrage of overlappting voices child spirits leave the doll bodies when killed

Workshop – strings are being pulled from the other sides & coming through the ceiling – A teleported in – It feels long untouched out of a side door, a hulking patchwork figure wearing a leather collar lurches out Frankenstein throws a net, A looses bat form, floor gives out beneath them A is suspended in room heavy w/ scent of blood (new workshop?)

We're all fleeing Melton's mouth starts opening wide, demonic skeleton emerging – Bone Gouge Asassin – disciples of Orcus

We're going through the mists 5 action countdown Eva counter charms Aaravos – helps break it Blank dimension doors themself & Aaravos (& the wand) out Vasra arcane gates Oesna & Eva out (having run out long before) Melton is left behind – consumed by the mists?
