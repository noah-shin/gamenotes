# Game Notes


I'm trying something new!

All my game notes will now be published here instead of writeas, just cause it'll be easier for me and hopefully easier to see which notes are for which game!

The active games I have notes for are:

Chaos & Cantrips (Vinnie's Tuesday game)
[[290-299 TTRPG/294 Finished Games/16 Chaos and Cantrips/1. Meet the Gang|1. Meet the Gang]] 

Blackthorn Guild (Lauren's Tuesday game)
[[290-299 TTRPG/295 Current Games/15 Blackthorn/BT Notes/Blackthorn Journal|Blackthorn Journal]] 

Forbidden Fey (Molly's Sunday game)
[[290-299 TTRPG/295 Current Games/16 Forbidden Fey/Journal/Forbidden Fey Journal|Forbidden Fey Journal]] 

Bubble Pop
