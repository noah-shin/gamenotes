penny gives potion of healing to a downed ansel

head to investigate offices - no signs to Watcher or to Baphomet
achy notices celestial runes etched into the floor
penny reads - magic of protection, hiding, locks, alarms, alerts - means a trap
in a 5x10 outline in corner of room

head to individual prep rooms
very regimental, same stuff in each room
minor personalisation, intials hidden on the walls or desk
names written into front pages of notebooks and prayer books
list of names!
names match the initials

one notebook - Jasper's - is slightly different
he believed in what he was doing, but not in Helm
used the notebook more like a diary than report
has more questions
' we haven't heard from the Watcher in a while'
'our orders have changed but they're supposed to still be from the Watcher?'
questions are not new and go back roughly three years
- things changes since then

ansel spils the tea about the headmaster, the bubble, and decapitation
ansel remembers something Taylor said about how the previous bubbles fell - should not have fallen so easily
there is a way to unlink the bubble and headteacher

ansel tries to phone taylor - goes through
T : we were unlinking the headteachers before killing them - but the bubbles fell anyway
T : we put the power into a generator into a runic circle our cleric found a diety to protect
T : ritual takes 6 hours
T : only ppl who could do it are taylor, prescott, the cleric, and cadis (who's now dead)

cadis is penny's dad

Taylor will send some cordinates to penny -  someone interesting is waiting and looking for them
is the cleric - on the underground's side and would never betray us
also helped heal ansel
it's pennys mom
underground found her, presumed dead, in the rubble of the explosion

conrad and bella's shadows are Soulstinger Demons
penny needs to get into their thoughts to free them

achy's dad moved to darkpit 3 1/2 years ago
came from Angelos
cause not much for the dad before - he was the warlock form head and RS teacher
dep head position fell into his lap

look through all rooms for achy's mom
all dead but Caleb - tall ginger green eyes freckles, terrified in a corner
no mom
get a bunch of healing potions from the stockroom

head to fight club to sleep

morning
achy's dad DECLINES THE CALL
lei and team arrive!
