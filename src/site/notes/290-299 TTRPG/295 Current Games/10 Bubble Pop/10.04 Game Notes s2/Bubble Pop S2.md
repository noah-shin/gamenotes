An 'But I thought it was okay and not that serious. But push came to shove and now I don't have magic.'
An 'I've been seeing things since I got here. I don't think he's too happy with me being here. He took my eye a year around, around when we joined that group.'

We notice that their eye moves independetly, An not controlling it.

Nyx attempts to call Vicky
- rings, doesn't go through
- she only allows certain ppl through during the workday
Ansel calls, phone rings for ages.
- Finally picked up, muffled, lots of noise, groaning and alarms
- There's a gurgle, she sounds _hurt_.
An 'Vicky. Please.'
V 'Nothing. Suits. Men attack. Not safe. Don't return. I tried getting to them. They're gone. So much blood, I can't, I wish I could move to them. Damien, Lei, Al. They're over there. I can't do anything'
We hear a series of explosions, deep, like Vicky's mutation.

Party sacrifices levels to try and resurrect folks :!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

#### 6. Investigation Time

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





25/06

Downtime

(lost the first page of notes lmao sos) (smthg about an assembly) (spooky vision) (nyx and ansel's downtime?)

Penny – spends it red threading connections between the people who died – x2 unconscious and x1 dead in the past two weeks — its sped up — cara and betti on same day (betty went missing the day before) —– they were together in the club —– Da was friends with Jackson (?)

-   dead people seem random-ish — not assigned to a group — top A ranks are dying — person dying coincides with paladins going missing
    
-   paladins going missing in a rotation? — every three weeks — random within the week
    
-   last taken 2 ½ weeks ago
    
-   no traces
    
-   along the same route — between the two underground connections
    
-   paladins don't have a family (renounced) (weakening connection to Helm)
    

Achlys – walks into VP Rand's office – convinces him to leave for a bit – finds the tournament itenirary — 1) dragon maze with riddles —– winner gets advs in the other tasks — 2) quiz — 3) battle between teams

-   teams from Darkpit are the Talons and us
-   from XXX – lightning coolers and stormbreaker – elemental magics
-   from XXX – chosen light and highfliers – celestial based
    
-   can find nothing from HM — rand seems to have all the power
    
-   hacks the comp — no name assigned to anything in 3 ½ years — Erun Crosshand —– cannot recall a matching face or even the name

-   nothing major coincided — other than turnover of teachers who retired — previous VP retired 5 years ago


Skylar – training telepathy and physical str — new and improved feat
