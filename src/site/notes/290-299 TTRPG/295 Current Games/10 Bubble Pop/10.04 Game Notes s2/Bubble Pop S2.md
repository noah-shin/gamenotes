Skylar vs Penny (P wins)

Octavio vs Ansel
- O sees something on Ansel's armour (paint?) and shuts up
- Fight keeps matching
- Ansel tries a Divine Intervention
-- A change over Ansel's features - rage and darkness around them
-- An slices through the wood of the pickaxe, doesn't look like they'll stop
-- An hearing a dark voice
- Yobi casts Detect Thoughts
-- Pulled into a dark void
--- Ansel sees bald older gentleman (Odin), holding a decorated spear
--- Only emotion present is agression
--- He puts the tip of his spear under Ansel's throat, tips their head back
' You broke our deal. Did you think there are no consequences? I gave you the means of revenge and you gave up?! I seek revenge now.'
--- He picks Ansel up by the throat, stabs him in the stomach.
Odin ' I take payment in blood. Yours, or someone else's, you decide.'
Ansel 'Mine'
Odin 'I thought you'd be smarter. I thought you'd ask what I meant by 'yours''

Yobi beams the image to the rest of the party
- We all feel those waves of heavy agression

Penny bows out the final

We all head to backroom
Y 'uncomplicate it for us'
An 'Back in Middlesborough, that shit led me to breaking my pact with my God. Things weren't the way we thought they were, as you know, and my god got mad.'
An 'But I thought it was okay and not that serious. But push came to shove and now I don't have magic.'
An 'I've been seeing things since I got here. I don't think he's too happy with me being here. He took my eye a year around, around when we joined that group.'

We notice that their eye moves independetly, An not controlling it.

Nyx attempts to call Vicky
- rings, doesn't go through
- she only allows certain ppl through during the workday
Ansel calls, phone rings for ages.
- Finally picked up, muffled, lots of noise, groaning and alarms
- There's a gurgle, she sounds _hurt_.
An 'Vicky. Please.'
V 'Nothing. Suits. Men attack. Not safe. Don't return. I tried getting to them. They're gone. So much blood, I can't, I wish I could move to them. Damien, Lei, Al. They're over there. I can't do anything'
We hear a series of explosions, deep, like Vicky's mutation.

Party sacrifices levels to try and resurrect folks :!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

25/06

Downtime

(lost the first page of notes lmao sos) (smthg about an assembly) (spooky vision) (nyx and ansel's downtime?)

Penny – spends it red threading connections between the people who died – x2 unconscious and x1 dead in the past two weeks — its sped up — cara and betti on same day (betty went missing the day before) —– they were together in the club —– Da was friends with Jackson (?)

-   dead people seem random-ish — not assigned to a group — top A ranks are dying — person dying coincides with paladins going missing
    
-   paladins going missing in a rotation? — every three weeks — random within the week
    
-   last taken 2 ½ weeks ago
    
-   no traces
    
-   along the same route — between the two underground connections
    
-   paladins don't have a family (renounced) (weakening connection to Helm)
    

Achlys – walks into VP Rand's office – convinces him to leave for a bit – finds the tournament itenirary — 1) dragon maze with riddles —– winner gets advs in the other tasks — 2) quiz — 3) battle between teams

-   teams from Darkpit are the Talons and us
-   from XXX – lightning coolers and stormbreaker – elemental magics
-   from XXX – chosen light and highfliers – celestial based
    
-   can find nothing from HM — rand seems to have all the power
    
-   hacks the comp — no name assigned to anything in 3 ½ years — Erun Crosshand —– cannot recall a matching face or even the name

-   nothing major coincided — other than turnover of teachers who retired — previous VP retired 5 years ago


Skylar – training telepathy and physical str — new and improved feat

</div></div>

30/8

In our stalking era
sneak into achyls' house
	penny distracts her dad
	head to achy's room to plan

ansel heads out via front door
	knocks on rand's office
	lmao randy about mr rand

head to main street
a&a, nyx & sky & pen

achy's mom dissapeared 3 / 4 months ago
	big churchgoer
	'i guess she's been kidnapped
	she had a cold and they cured her
	then she thought they would save everything

nyx and penny flirting

paladins approaching
go abnormally still
ground underneath shimmers
all three drop through the ground
time slows (chronomancy based)
the ground is real but the paladins are phasing through
moment of panic for all pallys - falling fast but can't speak or do anything
ground shimmering in golden sigil
- shape ansel drew in blood
- conrad's patron
they fall three and glowing has stopped

achy throws a ball bearing
ground shimmers again, but no slow
ball bearing bounces down steps
we feel like we're being invited

penny texts conrad
_its not him_
fail wis save
'fuck you'
penny hit by image of parents
- but older, but a 10 year old boy, playing together
- heads 'they used this power to start afresh'
- feels need to unearth the power to aid it
- conrad knows what he's doing, right?
- he must be saving it to tell me at the right moment
- - now, to join his crusade
stealing power was just the beginning
this is the endgame
- take down the church
- stop people being pawns of the church

27/8

we look at the stairs
nyx 5 insight check
spend _hours_ walking down the stairs
nothing to the sides, growing walls, encased

reach a doorway
above are braziers, baphomet's sigil in the walls
head a grinding, the door behind us is no longer there
muffled noises in the distance

we're in the ABYSS
doorways to abyss formed by the Collapse
punishment from the gods to the world

turn corner to see stell bull and minotaur
a&a start to turn to stone
p 'why have you put obstacles in our way?'
b 'my helpers must be strong. i do not accept weakness. i will weed out the unworthy'

ansel nat 1 wis save
transported to the hall of a thousand doors

penny realised bapho has thralled conrad recently
bull killed
it shimmers,  turns to stone, then dust

ansel - in the hallway
automatically walks to odin's room
o : you have an influence in the brain and i don't like my things being messed with
o : the way out requires a door, but doorways are tricky in the abyss
o : me saving you would cause a war, and you're not worht going to war over
a : let me milk this opportunity

nyx and sky recognise the flowing form of lei!
lei : i leave yall for three weeks! 
l : where's yobi?
l : the gov are buffoons, we're still on the run
l : did you not think that the soul draining thing was trying to leave the abyss?

achyls kills the mino

lei : we're being hunted. they may be aware you're all in darkpit
l : we have info. we need to meet, we'll be there soon

ansel sees overview of maze through the fake eye
head to a north room (still compelled)
hear sobbing, feel fear

walk in, a&a&p fail wis save
ansel sees amille and laura at home
' we didn't mean to scare you away. when are you coming home? '
sees the undercity get attacked
sees self finding amille and laura, dead

penny sees bubble city being created
watching parents set up a device from a control tower
hears a noise, then everything goes wrong
this time, its all fine, i have a younger brother
tinkering in my room, head a voice behind me, brother touches the wrong wire, everything goes black
this is what you wish for?
now conrad standing infront, eyes black
soulless laughter, he's enjoyed toying with me
raise gun to take him out, can't shoot him
irl raising gun to nothing (darkness is coalescing into a form infront of me)

achy sees perfect life, mother never got ill, so stayed with her
found a perfect team, became a government soldier
loses the entire team, because you're stealthed, and this is what you're good at
but not good enough
and you fall
come back, this team is _good_
but not sure if helping or hindering, but is this team working for the right goal, right people?
sees dad writing research, things that oppose Helm, and he's laughing

shadowy figure, no features visible, hear laughter
he's enjoying the emotional turmoil
he's gone, we pulled out of the trances

corner of room where shadows linger
ansel tosses a light stone
it flares and is swallowed by the dark
see writings of a madman across the walls
wall is undamaged by a bullet
achy touches it
ansel hears chuckling from the darkness
	pulls achy away
as we leave, achy hears a whispered 'i want a home'

next room, hear praying
ac stalths up, sees the three pallys who fell
room has number of corpses wearing the same armour
achy fakes being a dead pally
x2 pallys 'the watcher must be looking out for us as he sent you. our brothers are in between life and death'
one yawns, then falls fully unconscious

the watcher never changes, he's protected
pray to help and the watcher contacts us

we all 'pray' together
only pen and achy actually praying
nyx and sky mouthing it
ansel not even bothering
penny and achy fail wis save, tempted by our own shadow - convinced to head left

reach left room, achy reads Abyssal runes on it
a ritual room, sealed by chains
ach attacks the chain, then just pulls it off - burns their hand
lock revealed behind the chains
achy picks lock, door swings open to a deafened room
achy steps in, sits cross legged on the dias, candles start flickering

black shadowy figures reaching out from the walls, some fully stepping out
full figure behind ansel, a hand grapss his shoulder, then phases into him
ansel feels this cold
shadows urge penny to leave

make our way to the central room
chains of mithril unbar the way
room w/ cobblestones, gold and mithril statues
seven portals made of black and red vortexes = gradiant left to right
one in center on a raised dias

urge to through one of the gold statues
abyssal etchings around the doors
labelled 201-400, etc
gold statue labeled 'upper plane'
also reads 'savrifice knowledge or secret'
- means reveal a secret or give a memory (memory is random)

achy chooses knowledge rip
portal shows achy in an unfamiliar room - dep's office
searching through computer, strange files on screen
abyssal and deep speech
name unseen as she scrolls too fast
a run by Irune Crosshand - HM?

nyx gives secret - i killed my grandma the night the bubble fell
skylar secret - my adopted parents were responsible for the massacre in middlesborough
penny - i engineering my own coma
ansel - i need to kill someone for odin. I didn't want my loved ones to die so I'll someone else's
elijah - it'll be nice to see the sunshine for the first time in a millenia

next also stabbed twice, doesn't die

shadowy figures talk to us
achy and pen not to be harmed?

22/10

penny gives potion of healing to a downed ansel

head to investigate offices - no signs to Watcher or to Baphomet
achy notices celestial runes etched into the floor
penny reads - magic of protection, hiding, locks, alarms, alerts - means a trap
in a 5x10 outline in corner of room

head to individual prep rooms
very regimental, same stuff in each room
minor personalisation, initials hidden on the walls or desk
names written into front pages of notebooks and prayer books
list of names!
names match the initials

one notebook - Jasper's - is slightly different
he believed in what he was doing, but not in Helm
used the notebook more like a diary than report
has more questions
' we haven't heard from the Watcher in a while'
'our orders have changed but they're supposed to still be from the Watcher?'
questions are not new and go back roughly three years
- things changes since then

ansel spils the tea about the headmaster, the bubble, and decapitation
ansel remembers something Taylor said about how the previous bubbles fell - should not have fallen so easily
there is a way to unlink the bubble and headteacher

ansel tries to phone taylor - goes through
T : we were unlinking the headteachers before killing them - but the bubbles fell anyway
T : we put the power into a generator into a runic circle our cleric found a deity to protect
T : ritual takes 6 hours
T : only ppl who could do it are taylor, prescott, the cleric, and cadis (who's now dead)

cadis is penny's dad

Taylor will send some cordinates to penny -  someone interesting is waiting and looking for them
is the cleric - on the underground's side and would never betray us
also helped heal ansel
it's pennys mom
underground found her, presumed dead, in the rubble of the explosion

conrad and bella's shadows are Soulstinger Demons
penny needs to get into their thoughts to free them

achy's dad moved to darkpit 3 1/2 years ago
came from Angelos
cause not much for the dad before - he was the warlock form head and RS teacher
dep head position fell into his lap

look through all rooms for achy's mom
all dead but Caleb - tall ginger green eyes freckles, terrified in a corner
no mom
get a bunch of healing potions from the stockroom

head to fight club to sleep

morning
achy's dad DECLINES THE CALL
lei and team arrive!
