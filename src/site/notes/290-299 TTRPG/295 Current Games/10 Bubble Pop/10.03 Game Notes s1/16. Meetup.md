Texts - instant messages from Edmund, they're all our greatest wishes
Nyx - don't trust him! he killed Taylor
Ed - not entirely true. I returned her to her home

Taylor in all black turns the corner
- Ansel goes up to her
- She looks comfy, at ease. Eyes now grey.
- Ansel falls into her
- T - 'We have a fight to win. Who said I was dead?'
- An 'I killed him'
- T 'I wanted to kill him'

Ansel draws sword to fight the group if they go against Taylor

Bubble starts to break around us
There's a massacre in the forest
We all flee to the underground city
