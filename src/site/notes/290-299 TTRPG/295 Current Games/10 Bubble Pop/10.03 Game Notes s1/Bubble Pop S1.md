#### 1. Starting Times

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">





START -> [[290-299 TTRPG/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.03 Game Notes s1/02. First day of school|02. First day of school]]

Back in 2021, the world erupted into flames as countries turned on each other during what was meant to be peace talks but ended up being the destruction of the world. Rather than keeping cool heads and talking their way through the conflict like good leaders should, some leaders (who remain nameless in the history books, their existence wiped from public eye as penance ~~Trump~~) pushed those small red buttons. 

It is now 2055 and the world has never truly recovered the damage from the nuclear warheads not only killed the vast majority of the world but made the world nearly inhabitable for those who survived. As the world moved on beyond the fallout towards rebuilding and repopulating, they found that some of the individuals who had survived were mutated with special abilities or could now access magic. 

But it wasn’t just the surviving generation that was affected and as the future generations were also randomly mutated as well. In the process of rebuilding, bubble cities were created through the work of a brilliant scientist Dr Edmund Prescott, who many believe to have also been mutated by the fallout with magic abilities in order to have created the habitable cities that now populate our surface. 

The bubble cities such as the one you all call your home are works of magic and science mystery to many with few select individuals informed about the inner workings. A Bubble city is a liveable area where underneath a giant dome shield the large city is protected from the fallout. The secret behind the domes power is only know to the creator and the headmaster of each school.

However, despite these safe haven bubble cities, the world has been ravaged over the past 15 years ever since an underground war broke out onto the surface after the firebombing of Prescott’s family home, with both sides of the war accusing the other side of the death of their most prominent member.

The different sides to the war stand on different principles with two sides split into four factions all wanting control. The pro-mutant mutants who do not trust the pro-mutant humans which as a pro-mutant side are against the anti-mutant humans who do not understand the anti-mutant mutants. 

The war erupted onto the world suddenly, with bubble cities being attacked despite the secrets protecting them being held only by the most trusted and the dead. With the war suddenly starting, everyday citizens were pushed into wartimes without warning or understanding of the situation but quickly adapted as humans do and repurposed fallout suits that had been created for select individuals to go outside of the dome shield and fight outside of the bubble city, trying to stop the onslaught on the bubble cities themselves. 

Despite their attempts to keep the war outside of the Bubble cities, a few bubble cities have been destroyed even though the dome’s secret has been well protected. 

Bubble cities altered their schools from having normal school subject and a few extra-curricular based around mutations to focusing on students ability to fight and sue their mutants should they have them. The schools created teams of students to fight in the war and protect the bubble city in which they reside in. However, the school do not just specialise in those with mutations but rather anyone who is able to and want to join the fight.

Taylor on a mission for the next few weeks

Yobi going to see Laila Robinson
laila helped diagnose them with *something*
recommends a book that was destroyed last year
their condition will only get worse with time


Alanis : Lady Luck commune : don't waste this second chance ( their reappearance )
especially not just for chaos
nor always clear or wasted (?)
Damien isn't helping but also not hindering (distancing himself from Alanis)
(hidden: heartbroken but hiding it, feeling betrayed)

Ansel - hidden info
adopted father arrested & inquiring about it
looks for old friends (meeting two of the father's aquaintences in the tunnels)
one has old poorly healed injuries
gives Ansel a note
a noise spooks the pair
turns out to be Taylor
she's beaten up with a magical glowing shackle/bracelet (powerful & arcane, glows brigher when taylor is hurt)

Ansel  - dsylexic?
has an old lady guardian

Ansel dislocates taylor's thumb to try to take off the bracelet
fails to remove it, sends photo to gc
alanis sends to parents (about both bracelet but honestly more the thumb)
dad knows, quick call
parents turn up at the house (where Ansel has brought taylor) with Damien and the headmaster

HMWM  sees taylor as a soldier not daughter (?)

Damien does cool shield magic, bracelet snaps off, glow goes back into Taylor's body
Purple explosion inside the protective magic dome
Taylor wakes up, no glasses, HMWM gives the glasses (she has blindsight?)

Damien ties and zoned out, Taylor touches his shoulder, zap of purple light between Taylor & Damien

Alanis should be sorry for something else about Damien (not just the song?)

Nyx - mutation developed, now has access to magic
surname : Elleri
parents dead, lives with grandmother Moira (genetist) who is famous for her research (eg creation of mutants later on in life)

Skylar - training
has a turtle (who I would die for) called Terrence in a lil backpack

Talking to Taylor : she was sent on mission at the beginning of the downtime to investigate the missing mutants
she went missing in the tunnels, has a blur of time
The shackle controls the mutants and their power
She's been on multiple missions about this
Was taken by non-mutants
Feeling of a lot of darkness ??
Buzzing energy still within her
(hidden : knows what happened to Yobi (& their eyes) )
Card game bros with Alanis
has a mutated (to be smaller and not need ice) arctic fox

Other school teams
Yobi's old team : Pathfinders (yobi has the Explorer feat)
Al's : Hustlers (all CHA based)
Ansel's : Ringmasters 
Current teams 
Blaze Bandits
Kingsmen
Wrecking Crew
Stealth Outlaws
Enter Team Name Here
Adrenaline Alliance
Badass Brigade
No Sympathy Thrashers
Your Worst Nightmare
Mandatory Attendance
Alpha Team Archers
50 Shades of Age

We're going for the Silent Stumblers?

Then we played Truth or Dare within a Zone of Truth :

Ansel has had four parents (two biological, then father, then current guardian?)
Yobi lost their eyesight in a regretful mistake
Dared to take off the blindfold - does has eyes - covered in a dark veil (like reverse cataracts)
Starts shaking after a while
Sees something in Ansel (?) something dark and spread out?
Taylor feels resignation? unsurprised (probably thinks we're gonna ask her to take the sunglasses off)
Yobi asks Ansel : What are you? (!!!!!)

Damien was in Alanis' previous team
Taylor has been HMWM's ward for 15 years (linked to the Prescott fire 15 years ago? Did she cause it?)
(hidden : Ansel's father ran the cirus? )

Taylor's dogtag - V.P. (initials on it)
	Yobialso saw a key (shape thing) on a seperate chain around her neck
		MK (metaknowledge) : ( recognised it because they had stolen it in the past ? )
		 Yobi was caught going to the restricted library last time?
		 had a special item last time (no longer have it)
		 
Head to the park
Plan a bit of the heist (going to meet Taylor at lunch)
Alanis falls asleep, Nyx fails to hit, Ingram pecks them awake (-4HP)

Yelling from druid class during lunch
Giant chickens
Al used Fey Presence, got out the room, got the druid teacher to help

Met Taylor in the library (we need a classroom or space of our own, a la Community)
She couldn't remember much of the security
	Zone of Truth
Yobi, last time thought the security was lacking
	This is because it was based on individual signatures

Signatures are taken from us during the first battle in order to monitor us in school

MK? : The key on Taylor's neck provides a different signature

We can change the database (access in every teacher's room)
Nyx has 2 parents (no longer around) and lives with grandmother (Moira)
Taylor has 3 (HMWM as current)
Yobi had 3, currently 1 (though they are dead?)
HMWM was once married, but partner died at the end of the school year last year, shortly after Alanis got back. He currently has a crush on VP O'Sully

Al goes to [[290-299 TTRPG/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/Damien|Damien]]'s classroom (to get access to his comp but also for history)
D - pain at mention of 'team', especially at the mention of Lei (wave of guilt)
He's been going to the Ethereal Return a lot recently
D & A head off to ER bar

Nyx gets into the system (in the now empty classroom)
N - currently getting Fs. Clear school history
Yobi - getting Cs. Note : library break in, found injured, deferred for a year for treatment
Al - getting Cs. Team situation : was disbanded due to actions out of line with school regulations : unsanctioned mission. Deferred due to shady gambling / song / missing 6 months of school
Ansel - Cs and Ds. Absences from school due to 'past time hobby'. Team disbanded (all members left. One cleric hospitalised. Two dropped out. Three resits.)
Taylor - As. Deferred due to being the center of a 'sorcery incident' (the reason for the previous sorc teacher's death? Prof Ben saved them?). Past 4/5 missiong have ended with Taylor in hospital. Part of an 'unsanctioned mission with the Hustlers'
Damien - investigation in an unsanctioned mission. Beverament leave at the end of the school year (right before Al returned). Took final year exams a year early to become the teacher.

NOTE AL WRITES ON THEIR ARM : LOOK AT DAMIEN'S PHOTO LATER

Damien infodump :
Looking for Alanis. Found an underground fight club of mutants (run by non-mutants)
Hustlers went : Kelly and [[290-299 TTRPG/295 Current Games/10 Bubble Pop/10.00 Wiki/People/Lei|Lei]] went missing. Landon took Zane and got out of there. 
They called Charles Stiegan and Ibram Baxter (previous warlock and sorc teachers)
Kelly was dead. Lei magic shackled. Individual wearing a hood was attacking the group w/ Lei (because she was shackled)
Charles was greviously hurt.
The clerics took the shackle off Lei without looking so now she's in a coma ( the issue is with the wrong magic type ??? )
	Lei's mutation : misty step / teleportation
Landon had his hands hurt. He started gambling, got killed in a bar brawl by the owner of the Scorpion Bar.
Zanax was sad because he had lost his team. 
Damien sad because he had lost ???
D - kept the roses on his outfit & sword

Ansel doesn't like the ERB (ethereal return bar) - knows people there?
All 5 (?) are around the bar
	leading people to the back ???
	
Ansel was given a note by the shady five : 'we're dont waiting for what you owe us. You have 24 hours or we will take action' & photos of their house + blacksmith
Owes a lot of money to those 5 (around 1.5k each, 9.328 total)
In debt, using the money for a circus thing???

Started gambling to earn the money for Ansel
Blackjack, then poker. 

MK : Ansel finds the bad group.
	"Do you know Luke von Eiravael"
	( related to the circus name? )
	can (possibly) offer safe transport to the other Bubble cities
	can provide weapons?
MK : head of the 5 is Balacour Keenstriker (Mr K)
	& Seph Bringhammer / Zaphael Renzium / Lershom ? Dustiel / Z ???

Gave them the money, exchanged business cards, left.

Yobi goes to the large church w/ graveyard (was aiming to steal something?) – was the one to 'lay them to rest' – beloved mention, son – Y ' I'm sorry ' – recognised tombstones from research (tunnel w/ sorc teach Baxter?) — from when T killed him – 'beloved husband, step-father, teacher' – Y didn't know he was married

Skylar researches cities Wakefield – not a big force / Head was attacked but didn't use any of their magic (all Heads are extremely powerful) – bubble fell at same time as Head Heads never sent to fight Cities weren't all formed at once – Wake / Wolf / Aramor / Middlesborough / Dark / Angelos / Hold – was a failure of a city before Hold (named Wingston) where the bubble never went up

Evelyn & An – bro u need help, u look exhausted E gave Blake an apprenticeship at the hospital – he's alive An doesn't know which of the Ringmasters are dead, haven't seen some in a _year_ E ' we searched for the twins, but they weren't with the circus. we can't search for every student that runs away' E ' people in the tunnels aren't kind to anyone they suspect of being a mutant'

Y – last time HMWM made it real easy to get into the office – convinces HMWM to leave – his aura is JET BLACK (colours are deaths caused) – he has evocation & war magic books / silver & gold letter opener with a date engraved / student files / tea set / false bottom of drawer containing two rings engraved with same date / journal / key Date = 13/8/2037 Journal – diary entries that go back 20 years – 'been told my husband is so and so' – bff Edmund. Ed set him up w/ Ibrahim Baxter – Victoria/Vicky – his goddaughter & Ed's daughter – Prescott fire – date on letter opener & rings & Baxter wedding & Baxter's death — he couldn't do anything, but sat in a lil bubble was Vicky – Vicky in Witness Protection, now named Taylor – HMWM kinda blames her for the fire – Baxter dead (also caused by T) – HMWM would rather she or Ben died – he treats her like a weapon

TAYLOR HAS A GUN Head can't write or say aloud the secrets of the dome Stumblers confront T at tunnel entrance We're all going w/ T to Wolfhall (going past the cult fight club) Head magic linked w/ bubbles? (close but not quite)

Ansel – Insight checks Glowing Alanis – gets a blast of 'unknowable something', 11 dmg, goes DOWN AGAIN – their eyes gow slightly midnight blue before they get blown back and go unconscious Taylor – Arcana checks – becomes full of fear, unable to say anything Nyx uses Healing Potion, Ansel is back up

Ansel tries hold person, blue cage that fits around their skin, before gold light cracks and breaks through it Nyx tries tentacle grab Ansel tries Calm Emotions – success but does nothing?

Running – An can see electric blue along where Al is going Al dissapears in front of a door An draws on a sword on Zane – 'do you know where [Al] went?' – intimidation check fails, they just died like five times in a row – Zane ' we got you many pretty swords. we didn't have to'

Lockpick through Room of hospital beds/morgue slabs – lightning marks on the wall – bracelet stuck in a drain w/ 'Kelly' engraved – One grate, bloody — YOBI LICKS IT — tastes a bit of poison? very stale

Al is currently a passenger in their own body Voice in their head 'we'll get him this time. No second chances for Zanaxis' Al – 'let's get him' – has Magic Sight, 3 legendary resistances, +6 to all skills. SS DC 21, SA +13

drain passage more recent than the drain itself

Zanaxis is on the phone, texting, unaware of my presence – Failed Phantasmal Force, success Dissonant Whispers – Znx lightning dmg Al

Laura's daggers are An's first forgeries

Phantasmal Force again – success – Al turns into Lando and starts pressing down on Znx's laranyx with a fist (as though his hands are burnt through, lightning marks down them) – He gives a frustrated hurt desperate wail — “If you accepted the offer, you would still be here. We'd be ruling this together” – Al slices their throat with a card — Q of Spades – Tolld the Dead — “You dissapoint me” — Now coated in blood, still glowing Zane had – quaterstaff (jet black), arcane focus (necklace set in gold)

Taylor – “can we have Al back?” – Al shakes their head – Taylor shocked at a voice only they can hear – “No. I am protecting them. You can't keep them safe so I will.”

Yobi – Detect Thoughts – surface thoughts are like static – deeper is about Lady Luck

Taylor on the phone with Damien – “Al's patron has taken over to protect Al from mental/physical something” We make it back to the morgue Lei starts to appear Lei tackle hugs Al An plays Careless Whisper

Laura doesn't want to be near An Zane has a bonedeep exhaustion Al approaches Laura – “They didn't mean to –. They're sorry. But don't hurt them (threatening).” – Al also gives her a healing potion for Zane – Laura ? partially forgives them ?

First watch: Lei kisses Al Al regains control

Second watch: An to Laura – “I'm still a bit scared of you.” A – “Where have you been for the last year?” – “There was a job, went to shit, got detained, said nothing, went to a secret detainment funnel camp, escaped, then a day later we got caught by the cult.” A – “What was the job? No, I don't want to know” – “We were detained and escaped with Luke” – Luke hasn't contaced An A – “Have you heard anything about an execution?” – “No?!?!?!???” A – “I was looking into it, got a message a while ago from two guys mentioning it.”

Third watch: Yobi realises he actually likes this group. Fuck.

Noise along the tracks – group of 8 people walking towards Middlesborough – not average citizens – they wear insignias on their arms, holding weapons – one person (leader) has a different symbol Yobi wakes An – an recognises it – Seen on banners of antimutants – used in the actual war and not in smaller cults

Soldier – “I don't know why he (leader) wanted to skip that place to come here – it doesn't have that much importance, why aren't we sticking to the original plan?”

An wakes Taylor – who nearly stabs them with knife hidden under the pillow – An – oh shit that's attractive

Taylor checks the group – phones HMWM We finish sleeping – will head them off Laura and Zane are tired, Z has a phone. They'll seperate and find info on Luke.

Yobi sees Taylor's soul is dim and fading The medics are not rushing, given up (Ansel notices)

Ansel heads home, Alanis follows like lost puppy Nyx heads to the part Skylar heads home

Yobi heads into the hospital for info – nat 20 janitor outfit stealth – overheards the doctors — one isn't in the right uniform — pulls out a stopwatch, says 'i'll take her to the morgue' — it was an incomplete resurrection — engraving on stopwatch ; forever in love ... 2036 —– connected to HMWM's stuff??

I don't want to be around a murderer – Al ; what do you see in the mirror then? – An draws their sword – Al calls the bluff – An swings (don't intend to hit), cuts the grass at their feet – An pushes Al, sword at their chin, draws blood — can sense beneath Al's numbness is just a directionless miasma of rage – Al still follows, An swipes (-9HP) – An drops their sword, runs away – Al tries to follow but lost track, picks up the sword

Al heads to the hospital, finds Mirabel at the desk – She won't say anything about Taylor – Lei isn't here? — Yesterday, flash of light, an argument, she walked out w/ Damien – Taylor is in 'the Rose Cottage' — Al doesn't know what it means, sighs in relief

Al goes to their parents, who are very gentle w/ them – Follows them into a side room, they break the news – Al just _mad_, telekenetic slams them away, misty escapes to go find Taylor – Hunts through the morgue, Taylor isn't there — Parents come to, try to stop them ' Where is she?!' 'In autopsy? We don't know!' – They teleport him home — They try to struggle out, sleep spell fails, they get choked out unconscious

Yobi heads to forest – Tries to meditate w/ one of the souls that's been haunting them — Trying to make a pact? – Spirit of their guardian (haunting him since they died) – Derron Yobi ; I'm sorry D ; Everyone has their regrets Y ; I'm haunted by mine D ; Haunted or aided? Y ; Isn't that for you to decide, my friends? D ; I'd hope we are more than friends Y ; What will it cost for you to aid me? D ; Nothing Y ; Sure. Take what you want. I want you to kill HMWM. He must suffer, I want to know why he's done this D ; Do you want to do it, us to aid you? Y ; I have enough blood on my hands. What's a few more drops. — Spends the rest of their time hunting for info about HMWM

It lies along vengeance and revenge – Blows out the candles, hears 'Farewell, my child of pain'. – Texts the twins, 'gonna kill some guy, are you in?' – L ; we've got your back, we're on our way — Then destroys their phone

Nyx heads to the park, deeply concerned theyre in too deep – Lost their parents in the war they are now participating in – They aren't strong enough to protect the people they care about — Stares at the stars instead of doing anything – Realises they had info about Taylor and their grandma they can no longer share – Finds info on 'vaults' with base data / research (within Middlesborough) – Grandma has been sensitive but frustrated? ' Time wasted, all of that gone ' – Grandmother was only able to continue their research with a grant from HMWM

Al wakes up, damien talking to parents downstairs – Heads to Damien's, to school, pushes HMWM against the wall A ; Where's Taylor?
