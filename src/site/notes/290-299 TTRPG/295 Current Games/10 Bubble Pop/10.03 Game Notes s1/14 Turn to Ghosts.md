10/2/22

Yobi sees Taylor's soul is dim and fading The medics are not rushing, given up (Ansel notices)

Ansel heads home, Alanis follows like lost puppy Nyx heads to the part Skylar heads home

Yobi heads into the hospital for info – nat 20 janitor outfit stealth – overheards the doctors — one isn't in the right uniform — pulls out a stopwatch, says 'i'll take her to the morgue' — it was an incomplete resurrection — engraving on stopwatch ; forever in love ... 2036 —– connected to HMWM's stuff??

Al follows Ansel – An tries to get them to go away – Al – i will, i just – why didn't you _do_ anything? – An packs a go bag, all their altar stuff – Al sat outside – An tries to insult them ; stop following me! I don't want to be around a murderer – Al ; what do you see in the mirror then? – An draws their sword – Al calls the bluff – An swings (don't intend to hit), cuts the grass at their feet – An pushes Al, sword at their chin, draws blood — can sense beneath Al's numbness is just a directionless miasma of rage – Al still follows, An swipes (-9HP) – An drops their sword, runs away – Al tries to follow but lost track, picks up the sword

Al heads to the hospital, finds Mirabel at the desk – She won't say anything about Taylor – Lei isn't here? — Yesterday, flash of light, an argument, she walked out w/ Damien – Taylor is in 'the Rose Cottage' — Al doesn't know what it means, sighs in relief

Al goes to their parents, who are very gentle w/ them – Follows them into a side room, they break the news – Al just _mad_, telekenetic slams them away, misty escapes to go find Taylor – Hunts through the morgue, Taylor isn't there — Parents come to, try to stop them ' Where is she?!' 'In autopsy? We don't know!' – They teleport him home — They try to struggle out, sleep spell fails, they get choked out unconscious

Yobi heads to forest – Tries to meditate w/ one of the souls that's been haunting them — Trying to make a pact? – Spirit of their guardian (haunting him since they died) – Derron Yobi ; I'm sorry D ; Everyone has their regrets Y ; I'm haunted by mine D ; Haunted or aided? Y ; Isn't that for you to decide, my friends? D ; I'd hope we are more than friends Y ; What will it cost for you to aid me? D ; Nothing Y ; Sure. Take what you want. I want you to kill HMWM. He must suffer, I want to know why he's done this D ; Do you want to do it, us to aid you? Y ; I have enough blood on my hands. What's a few more drops. — Spends the rest of their time hunting for info about HMWM

Ansel has a major panic attack, then stealths into the hospital Overhears 'That Nim kid's escapes, heading to the morgue, knocked their parents unconscious upstairs.' – Ansel leaves, immediately back into a panic attack, heading into the tunnels, passes out – Wakes up, not mugged, tries to pray, candles out in the empty tunnel — Gets a voice back, deep and gravely — ; If you cannot heal, then your path doesn't lie along this road. It lies along vengeance and revenge – Blows out the candles, hears 'Farewell, my child of pain'. – Texts the twins, 'gonna kill some guy, are you in?' – L ; we've got your back, we're on our way — Then destroys their phone

Nyx heads to the park, deeply concerned theyre in too deep – Lost their parents in the war they are now participating in – They aren't strong enough to protect the people they care about — Stares at the stars instead of doing anything – Realises they had info about Taylor and their grandma they can no longer share – Finds info on 'vaults' with base data / research (within Middlesborough) – Grandma has been sensitive but frustrated? ' Time wasted, all of that gone ' – Grandmother was only able to continue their research with a grant from HMWM

Al wakes up, damien talking to parents downstairs – Heads to Damien's, to school, pushes HMWM against the wall A ; Where's Taylor? W ; I cremated her (Al fails insight) Al punches him (ripple in the bubble, only Yobi spots from the forest) A ; Where's Taylor?! W ; Dead. Al punches him again, teachers seperate them (2nd ripple) W ; I think we should try expulsion A ; I think you should have some fucking compassion for your daughter. – Al misty escapes away
