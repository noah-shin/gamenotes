Taylor on a mission for the next few weeks

Yobi going to see Laila Robinson
laila helped diagnose them with *something*
recommends a book that was destroyed last year
their condition will only get worse with time


Alanis : Lady Luck commune : don't waste this second chance ( their reappearance )
especially not just for chaos
nor always clear or wasted (?)
Damien isn't helping but also not hindering (distancing himself from Alanis)
(hidden: heartbroken but hiding it, feeling betrayed)

Ansel - hidden info
adopted father arrested & inquiring about it
looks for old friends (meeting two of the father's aquaintences in the tunnels)
one has old poorly healed injuries
gives Ansel a note
a noise spooks the pair
turns out to be Taylor
she's beaten up with a magical glowing shackle/bracelet (powerful & arcane, glows brigher when taylor is hurt)

Ansel  - dsylexic?
has an old lady guardian

Ansel dislocates taylor's thumb to try to take off the bracelet
fails to remove it, sends photo to gc
alanis sends to parents (about both bracelet but honestly more the thumb)
dad knows, quick call
parents turn up at the house (where Ansel has brought taylor) with Damien and the headmaster

HMWM  sees taylor as a soldier not daughter (?)

Damien does cool shield magic, bracelet snaps off, glow goes back into Taylor's body
Purple explosion inside the protective magic dome
Taylor wakes up, no glasses, HMWM gives the glasses (she has blindsight?)

Damien ties and zoned out, Taylor touches his shoulder, zap of purple light between Taylor & Damien

Alanis should be sorry for something else about Damien (not just the song?)

Nyx - mutation developed, now has access to magic
surname : Elleri
parents dead, lives with grandmother Moira (genetist) who is famous for her research (eg creation of mutants later on in life)

Skylar - training
has a turtle (who I would die for) called Terrence in a lil backpack

Talking to Taylor : she was sent on mission at the beginning of the downtime to investigate the missing mutants
she went missing in the tunnels, has a blur of time
The shackle controls the mutants and their power
She's been on multiple missions about this
Was taken by non-mutants
Feeling of a lot of darkness ??
Buzzing energy still within her
(hidden : knows what happened to Yobi (& their eyes) )
Card game bros with Alanis
has a mutated (to be smaller and not need ice) arctic fox

Other school teams
Yobi's old team : Pathfinders (yobi has the Explorer feat)
Al's : Hustlers (all CHA based)
Ansel's : Ringmasters 
Current teams 
Blaze Bandits
Kingsmen
Wrecking Crew
Stealth Outlaws
Enter Team Name Here
Adrenaline Alliance
Badass Brigade
No Sympathy Thrashers
Your Worst Nightmare
Mandatory Attendance
Alpha Team Archers
50 Shades of Age

We're going for the Silent Stumblers?

Then we played Truth or Dare within a Zone of Truth :

Ansel has had four parents (two biological, then father, then current guardian?)
Yobi lost their eyesight in a regretful mistake
Dared to take off the blindfold - does has eyes - covered in a dark veil (like reverse cataracts)
Starts shaking after a while
Sees something in Ansel (?) something dark and spread out?
Taylor feels resignation? unsurprised (probably thinks we're gonna ask her to take the sunglasses off)
Yobi asks Ansel : What are you? (!!!!!)

Damien was in Alanis' previous team
Taylor has been HMWM's ward for 15 years (linked to the Prescott fire 15 years ago? Did she cause it?)
(hidden : Ansel's father ran the cirus? )
