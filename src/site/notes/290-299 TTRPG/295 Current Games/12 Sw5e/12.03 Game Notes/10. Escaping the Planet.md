18/6

Korith wakes, with bright blue eyes – before he was near, composed. – now he's a little messier, bit of stubble – focus adrift, looks at his hand, then his saber – tries to go back to sleep.

---

K meditating, opens eyes to see black mountains and clear blue skies – stood at the edge of a cliff – At the base is a river of magma, bright, though it seems peaceful – recognises the planet, the same spot — Sullust faltering step towards the hut – “Master?” hand on shoulder, Vesper behind her, weak and struggling force presence

Have a lovely chat – he's kinda sus? wants the 'cron – K insistent on putting the twins first

-

Twins – kyber in their hands – el lies about not having a vision – ey fakes that their crystal is whole

head towards the exist – hears footsteps, a lil muttering – light at the end of the tunnel – outer cave feels welcoming and safe

now in a large lively library – young kion runs past – hears to a younger vesper, who clocks the twins trying to stealth follow – el picks up an old book in shyriwook – ey picks up brief instructions on the construction of sabers

vesper starts to talk to them – 'i want to make sure the closest thing i have to family is safe' – 'i ask you to help bring kion to me' – 'when the temple was seiged, i tried to fight. i fought the traitor at the gate and lost. i threw everything i had at the force and ran'

twins are like ... sus bro – we heard u tho

-

back to the cave – kion stands – chat about vesper, and the crystals and their purposes – k reassures ey about the split crystals ('mine broke once as well')

head out into the worse snow – k lights saber and leads way back – ship is bured under snow – battery dead

we fight a monster – el uses lightning (dark oops)

we get comms to kav – we're on our own off the planet

we head back to the temple – k confronts el – 'until i know how u feel about the jedi and their motivation, my guidance will be limited'

ey tries meditating – korith appears infront of her k 'this is a trick, a test' e 'id rather be honest than pretending to be something im not' k 'like a jedi?' e 'i hope to be one, tho i dont know if i'll deserve it' k 'good luck with a teacher like kion' e 'sometimes its not the teacher but how you use the lessons' e 'but how are you?' k 'it doesn't matter' e 'ofc it does' k 'stop lying to me' e 'im not'

korith places his hands on her head – she lets him – his eyes go wide, he steps back

k 'you have to leave. i don't have a choice. i'm a puppet of far greater beings, and as much as I hate that, I hate other things more' e 'You've been a weapon for others. What if you choose not to be?'

Ki casts force concealment on the 'cron – meditates on vesper – they have a lovely chat bvsdbds — k 'i can't believe you thought that i would just drag them with me' — k 'we've both changed, and i don't know how.'

El rests – in a similar room, but k + ey are transparent – staircase going up — transition from natural rock to man made metal – approaches a wide hangar bat – coming out a ship is a young girl and older woman – wearing robes of one of the skeletons – walking towards ceremonial door w/ jedi symbol – they arrive in the temple main – woman sits (where we found the corpse) – el follows the padawan — sees her previous vision —– self on throne and self freeing ey —– also sees countless other young jedi —— some rewarded, some never leave

returns to real temple, side passage still open everyone awake and rested

head up the stairs, hear wind – chat about trust – there's an old rusted ship

---

corner of some shady cantina in some shithole of a planet – a puck placed before a figure – it flashes, showing the twins thrandosian 'you know how to find them' freedo draws his blaster
