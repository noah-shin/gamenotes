Arrive home, in a tavern
Bastien - barkeep
Giving out a shady purple drink
- contains 'Fey oil' - absolute bullshit
- its just stuff found and bottled on the beach

Sorrel's necklace is stolen
- start bar fight
- sneak out

Pass thieves guild towards church of Helios
- looks silent and shutdown
Sharp scuttling
- x2 giant rats with shimmering coats
- we Smush them
- x2 guard druids - priests of Helios

Calm them
See pens & posters of the giant rats
- the town now holds them in high regard
- recent development

at top of ladde, hear a slow clap
- hooded figure appears
- eyes slightly dulled over
- ' your jewels will make perfect additions to my master's collection '
- shadowy mask appears for a second over his face

fight
shatter the purple jar at his waist
- same as the cocktail from earlier
- he drops to his knees ' who are you? '
- ' i'm Alex, the assassin's guild's apprentice '
- ' i remember nothing after my master said i would amount to nothing '

we head to Old Uncle's 
- who knew where alex got the purple seawater
OU 'I've been waiting for you, Keepers of the Jewels'
