Ash: Sage - emerald dragonborn, draped in white and gold scarves, confident but young, many pockets and pouches, herbalist stuff, very comforting presence.

Talking to [[290-299 TTRPG/295 Current Games/15 Blackthorn/BT Wiki/NPCs/Morgantha\|Morgantha]] - wearing a large glittery crown and ornate gown (going as one of the Queens from Disney)

We arrive at the house
Mr Demontford IV leads up to ballroom - white and gold ballroom, massive red curtains, giant picture of family at one end of hall

Meet Sage
_they are the wellness tent coach_

Head to front door, set up
Morgantha turns up - must be who they are, and good costumes (only royalty let in without a costume)
No approved press
Most ppl coming having magic weapons

Ball starts
lmao we have nothing to determine who they are (jessssss)
Mithseis Ozdemir (Cowboy) &  Rihala Sahin (Cowboy)
Hamfo Banksi    Fairy Prince of court &  Camellia Banksi    Fairy Princess
Thymeros Samm    Centaur as a centaur

Throughout the night, we let in 16 people, some people turned away (bad costumes, trying to fake their id, etc)
NAT 20 FOR BOTH INSIGHT AND PERCEPTION

Surprise guest - tall figure walking up the drive, dressed as a roman gladiator, royal crest on his bicep
rudy trips and face plants, silk pulls Jackie into a bow, he ignore us and heads straight inside.

then hesitates over closing the door
S to R: how much does blackthorn mean to you? do we want to be trapped in here with _him_?
Jasper follows him through, now on the prince's shoulder

Silk and Jackie post up next to doors inside ballroom
N posted up outside
R head to medic tent

Sage ambushes R in the quiet room
R shares that someone's arrived that isn't a fan of them
Sage tries give them some helpful makeup to obfuscate their identity

Silk feels familiar watching the ballroom
Loud meow -  Prince now next to me, putting cat on the ground. 
P: 'I think this cat, it belongs to your friend'
Si: This is better than anything from 'home'
Something flutters past his face I can't recognise
P: At least you have the luxury of leaving
he leaves
silk follows him 
he whirls around : freedom is a luxury few afford. you have escaped your little cage, enjoying things, you look better like this than as him
-> fully telling the truth
silk : say hi to the parents for me
he scoffs, lightly, almost at the idea of talking to his parents, or at the idea of me claiming thing as my parents

Jackie in ballroom, watches group of three angels by drinks table start gasping in pain, before turning to stone.
