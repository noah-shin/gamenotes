Surprise guest - tall figure walking up the drive, dressed as a roman gladiator, royal crest on his bicep
rudy trips and face plants, silk pulls Jackie into a bow, he ignore us and heads straight inside.

then hesitates over closing the door
S to R: how much does blackthorn mean to you? do we want to be trapped in here with _him_?
Jasper follows him through, now on the prince's shoulder

Silk and Jackie post up next to doors inside ballroom
R and N head to medic tent

Sage ambushes R in the quiet room
R shares that someone's arrived that isn't a fan of them
Sage tries give them some helpful makeup to obfuscate their identity

Silk feels familiar watching the ballroom
Loud meow -  Prince now next to me, putting cat on the ground. 
P: 'I think this cat, it belongs to your friend'
Si: This is better than anything from 'home'
Something flutters past his face I can't recognise
P: At least you have the luxury of leaving
he leaves
silk follows him 
he whirls around : freedom is a luxury few afford. you have escaped your little cage, enjoying things, you look better like this than as him
-> fully telling the truth
silk : say hi to the parents for me
he scoffs, lightly, almost at the idea of talking to his parents, or at the idea of me claiming thing as my parents

Jackie in ballroom, watches group of three angels by drinks table start gasping in pain, before turning to stone.
