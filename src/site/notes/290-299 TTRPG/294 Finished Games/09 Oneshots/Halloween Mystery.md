### Introduction

Mossly Town
- 60 years old
- Alongside the short of a river in the mountains and forest
- Normally very peaceful, the town bands together to fight the monsters in the forest

Nobody goes into the McRory manor at the edge of town.

## Legend
(notes by Jess)

McRory family legend
+50 years ago, McRory's owned town
ALL DIED LOL - no-one knows how / why; it's giving dick-tater
35 years -> 67 ppl have died in McRory manor - haunted
4 years after MR death -> first deaths; Halloween (pumpkin drawing)
currently empty - cursed?

(back to me)
On the 50th anniversary, there was an expose
people who'd adventured in
or some people who'd just disappeared - maybe not even from the house but no other conclusive evidence

48 ppl lived and died there
rest were just visiting
everyone died over Halloween

It's not magic, it's just murder.

In our hearse, speed towards the manor, flames out the exhaust, mega speakers

Haunted house, overgrown dead plants, 2 floors + attic
Huge lands, it's foggy and dark, no magic detected outside

### graveyard

shapes of snakes in the fog - from Lilth's headband?
Fog getting heavier and can't be moved with a cantrip
Hallow and God trip on way - 10HP

Crypt - gold detail, towering pillars, mostly open space with some side rooms
Lilith doesn't find any mechanical traps
Angelic statue moves when no-one looks at it
Angel gets nat 20 to hit!

Hunger of hadar lmao
statues are older than the town records

back to graveyard
short rest
full of family members - not immediate (theyre in the main crypt)

hallow heads solo down a crypt corridor to side chamber
plaques across the wall
main mcrory family names
a missing name (not outside either) - NICHOLAS MCRORY
died with the family 50 years ago

everyone digs up a body
lilith gets 7 knucklebones
died before the massacre - 350 years ago

### house

foyer
to entrance halls
hallow pushes puck in
wall of flame, face on wall speaks (only) to Puck
'They arrive every night ...' -> Stars
wall of flame dissapears

H to living room - grabs a page from the fireplace
rambling of someone gone mad : ppl turning against them, family not listening, need to get them back in line

L heads to study
grabs a book on family history
same handwriting all the way through (same as the letter)
Nicholas - born 900 years ago, no death date

Scrappy Eef looks around house
reports back, shaking
heard footsteps throughout the house, blood on the wall, drag marks, etc
appears throughout the house, not an illusion

P&G in the basement
move the freezer - shows glowing rune on floor - chronomancy
ancient, original magic - describes a timeloop, showing what happening
and keeping it locked to this time - a warning - showing of power and strength

room looks relatively undisturbed
drag marks ~50 years old

ppl are dying cause theyre trespassing
rune is a deterrent to scare ppl away

scratch out the rune
freezer turns into two vampires!

v: all our victims are willing and left very well paid
v: we last killed ppl 5 years ago when ppl moved in

try to avoid combat
they go for G
why won't they die!

awesome library bombing sequences
house on Fireeee

someone stole our hearse!
